Discussion Title: The Correct Donation: Gorillas or Starving Children?

1. People should donate to organisations that support gorillas instead of to those that support starving children.
1.1. Con: Saving gorillas has less impact on the donor's own well-being than saving a child.
1.1.1. Pro: Donations to children reduce the need for tax-financed foreign aid.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Often development aid is channeled to starving children. Donations to starving children will thus reduce the need for this aid while donations to gorillas do not reduce the need for it.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Eradicating child malnutrition allows for better [brain development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11515234), which helps poorer societies to generate a generation that can free the country from poverty.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: Eradicating malnutrition would also decrease the number of childhood deaths which would increase the overall population.
1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Earth is suffering from overpopulation. Thus, humanity is not in need for more children.
1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: The ethically correct way to combat overpopulation would be to prevent future excess births instead of allowing living human beings to suffer and die.
1.1.1.2.1.1.2. Con: High rates of childhood mortality [are connected to](http://www.ageing.ox.ac.uk/download/143) high fertility rates as parents want to increase the chance of at least one child reaching adulthood. In order to reliably combat overpopulation, childhood mortality thus has to be reduced and donations should be made to starving children.
1.1.1.2.1.1.3. Pro: The gradual degeneration of humans' ecological niche, such as rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, global warming, and pollution is aggravated by population expansion.
1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: Overpopulation is [accelerating](http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/population_and_sustainability/climate/) climate change because population growth results in higher consumption.
1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1. Con: It is not overpopulation, but overconsumption that is causing climate change. \([theguardian.com](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/19/not-overpopulation-that-causes-climate-change-but-overconsumption)\)
1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: We produce much more than what we can consume. Thus it is not overconsumption but overproduction.
1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: [Millions](http://www.thelocal.de/20150619/germans-waste-18m-tonnes-of-food-yearly) of tons of food are thrown away in Germany every year.
1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.1.2. Con: To feed the world food production needs to be increased by [70%](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/28/un-farmers-produce-food-population) to keep pace with population growth and sustain global food security.
1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.1.3. Con: The level of production is responsive to demand.
1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.2. Con: Humans have to eat. To produce the food they need to engage in agricultural activities at such a scale that it causes climate change.
1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.2.1. Con: Innovative farming technologies would produce sufficient food while being integrated in a humane lifestyle.
1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: [Vertical Farming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_farming) has the potential to produce significant amounts of food on limited space.
1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Depending on the method of electricity generation used, regular greenhouse produce can create [more greenhouse gases](http://www.lcafood.dk/Material/How%20to%20prepare.pdf) than field produce, largely due to higher energy use per kilogram of produce. With vertical farms requiring much greater energy per kilogram of produce, mainly through increased lighting, than regular greenhouses, the amount of pollution created will be much higher than that from field produce.
1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: As plants acquire nearly all their carbon from the atmosphere, greenhouse growers commonly supplement CO2 levels to 3–4 times the rate normally found in the atmosphere. This [increase in CO2](http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/00-077.htm), which has been shown to increase photosynthesis rates by 50%, contributes to the higher yields expected in vertical farming.
1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: It is not uncommon to find greenhouses burning fossil fuels purely for this purpose, as other CO2 sources such as furnaces contain pollutants such as sulphur dioxide and ethylene which significantly damage plants.
1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.2.1.2. Con: None of them has been successful in changing the fundamental process.
1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Not yet. You never know what will happen in the future.
1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.2.2. Con: It is not about producing food "for need" as most of it is thrown away.
1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Every year, consumers in [industrialized countries](http://www.worldfooddayusa.org/food_waste_the_facts) waste almost as much food as the entire net food production of sub-Saharan Africa.
1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.2.2.2. Pro: Without "mass production" there would still be enough food worldwide, if food was [distributed](http://www.worldwatch.org/node/4060) fairly and equally.
1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.2.2.3. Con: It is not about overproduction, it is about literally feeding all humans with the calories they need. For this there would be still climate change occuring.
1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.2.2.3.1. Con: The world already produces enough food for [several billions](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eric-holt-gimenez/world-hunger_b_1463429.html) more.
1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.2.2.3.1.1. Pro: Approximately 1/3rd of the food produced in the world for human consumption is either [lost or wasted](http://www.endfoodwastenow.org/index.php/resources/facts).
1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.2.2.3.2. Pro: It is [nearly impossible](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/09/why-hard-stop-climate-change) to stop climate change.
1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.2.2.3.3. Pro: Hunger will be reduced by [2080](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_and_agriculture#Food_security) because of social and economic modernization. This will drive climate change.
1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.2.3. Pro: Food production accounts up to 1/3 of global greenhouse gases. \([nature.com](http://www.nature.com/news/one-third-of-our-greenhouse-gas-emissions-come-from-agriculture-1.11708)\)
1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.2. Con: Most of the global population is not taking part in climate destroying activities as they are living in underdeveloped countries. Climate change is caused by the wealthy few unrelated to the majority of humankind.
1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.3. Con: Countries with big populations like India or China have not been major CO2 emitters in decades.
1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.3.1. Pro: Even today, their per capita emissions are lower than in the Western world.
1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.3.2. Con: China accounted for [11%](http://www.wri.org/blog/2014/11/6-graphs-explain-world%E2%80%99s-top-10-emitters) of cumulative emissions in 2011. This trend is increasing quickly as it was only [7%](http://pdf.wri.org/navigating_numbers_chapter6.pdf) in 2002.
1.1.1.2.1.1.4. Pro: Overpopulation is causing the consumption of water and natural resources at faster pace than the rate of regeneration resulting in a deterioration of living conditions.
1.1.1.2.1.1.4.1. Con: Overpopulation does not cause the consumption of natural resources at a faster pace but technical development and industrialization.
1.1.1.2.1.1.4.1.1. Con: The [Interacademy Panel Statement on Population Growth](https://web.archive.org/web/20100210203604/http://www.interacademies.net/?id=3547) has stated that many environmental problems, such as rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, global warming and pollution are aggravated by the population expansion.
1.1.1.2.1.1.4.1.1.1. Con: In this sense overpopulation is an amplifier but not the cause of environmental problems.
1.1.1.2.1.1.4.1.2. Pro: Most resources are consumed by a fraction of global population. The G-7 accounts for nearly [50%](http://www.cfr.org/international-organizations-and-alliances/group-seven-g7/p32957) of world GDP.
1.1.1.2.1.1.4.2. Con: 17% of the population consume 80% of total resources.  Increasing global population can thus hardly be a major driver of climate change. \([worldcentric.org](http://worldcentric.org/conscious-living/social-and-economic-injustice)\)
1.1.1.2.1.1.4.2.1. Con: Encouraged by the 17%'s wealth, the rest is trying to develop and probably act same or similar. The planet earth can hardly provide so many resources and therefore such a high standard of living for all humans.
1.1.1.2.1.1.4.3. Con: If we do not exploit resources we cannot enjoy the lifestyle we have now and would have to accept deteriorated living conditions.
1.1.1.2.1.1.4.3.1. Pro: Our economy and society is dependent on economic growth. If we do not grow despite shrinking population there is a big crisis and measures are taken to remedy the situation.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5. Con: There is no overpopulation.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.1. Pro: Overpopulation has been a [constant theme](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/14/opinion/14iht-edminois14.html) of humankind throughout all ages. Those feelings of overpopulation are however purely imagined as a threat through human existence.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.1.1. Con: Whether the earth feels overpopulated is a subjective claim that is irrelevant to whether or not the earth is overpopulated.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.1.2. Con: The argument from historical precedent is irrelevant here. The primary determinants of the Earth's massive population growth have been huge increases in food production, made possible by the [Green Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution), and breakthroughs in medicine. Although these conditions have greatly increased the Earth's carrying capacity, neither means that there is no upper limit to sustainable population levels, as the argument implies.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.2. Pro: Global [fertility rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_fertility_rate) declined and therefore population growth is slowing down and will eventually become negative.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.2.1. Con: Even by the most [conservative estimates](https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Graphs/Probabilistic/POP/TOT/), the world's population will continue to grow until at least 2050. The declining fertility rates thus will not lead to a population decline in the near future.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.2.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4. Pro: If there would be overpopulation humankind would not grow more. Apparently the globe is able to carry more humans than are there now.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.1. Pro: Food resources are sufficient for humankind. That is why they keep growing.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.2.2.3.1.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.3. Con: There is no biological or social mechanism that would limit human reproduction based on the world's population.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.3.1. Con: The lack of food would limit human reproduction to levels sustainable to global food production.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.3.1.1. Pro: Human population growth follows the [availability](http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/bystrc/courses/population/foodpop.pdf) of food.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.3.1.2. Con: It is entirely possible for a population to temporarily "[overshoot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overshoot_\(population\))" its sustainable levels.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.4. Con: In less than 8 Months, humanity exhausted Earth's budget for the year 2016 \([Earth Overshoot Day](http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/earth_overshoot_day/) was on August 8\). This clearly indicates that the population growth is not a healthy one, as humankind consumes too many resources too fast.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.4.1. Con: Most of the Earth's budget was consumed by a fraction of the global population in the Global North. Thus, the consumption of resources is not caused by population growth but by lifestyle of developed countries.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.5. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.3.1.2.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.6. Con: Overpopulation by [definition](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/overpopulation) \("excessive population of an area to the point of overcrowding, depletion of natural resources or environmental deterioration"\) does exist.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.6.1. Con: The maximum population of a species is defined by the [carrying capacity](https://www.boundless.com/biology/definition/carrying-capacity/) of its ecological niche. As humans grow in number there is obviously room for a higher population.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.2.2.3.1.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.6.1.2. Con: But carrying capacity is more precisely [defined](http://www.sustainablemeasures.com/node/33) by "the population \[that\] can be supported indefinitely." It is unclear that present food production levels \(and the energy and resource inputs it requires\) are sustainable indefinitely.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.6.1.2.1. Pro: There is a likely possibility that within the next 100 years [climate change](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16384-billions-could-go-hungry-from-global-warming-by-2100/) has a negative effect on food production.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.6.1.2.2. Pro: Our current food production is reliant on fossil fuels, which is not a long term solution.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.6.2. Con: As of now neither resources are depleted nor is the environment degraded to such a state that humans could not live anymore on Planet Earth.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.6.2.1. Pro: There are always new resource fields discovered and developed.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.6.2.1.1. Con: Despite new discoveries [peak oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_oil) has been passed and resource extraction is on a path of inevitable decline.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.6.2.1.2. Con: Discoveries of new oil and gas reserves have [drop](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/def8d8f4-b532-11e4-b186-00144feab7de.html)ped to 20-year low. Thus, new fields are not endless.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.6.2.1.3. Pro: [Shale gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shale_gas) has become a recent phenomena.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.6.2.1.4. Pro: With better [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offshore_drilling#Challenges) offshore oil field exploitation in deep sea become more feasible, such as the invention of sub-sea installations.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.6.2.1.5. Pro: Offshore [Myanmar](http://www.offshore-mag.com/articles/2016/02/woodside-discovers-more-deepwater-gas-offshore-myanmar.html) more oil was found.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.6.2.1.6. Pro: The melting [Arctic](http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/press/speeches/future-trends-in-global-oil-and-gas-exploration.html) provides plenty of opportunities to exploit yet untapped resources.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.6.2.1.6.1. Con: The melting Arctic is a vivid example of environment degradation that is turning the Earth into a [less](http://www.ibtimes.com/global-warming-melting-arctic-ice-doubling-risk-harsh-european-winters-study-says-1714013) and [less](http://www.unknowncountry.com/insight/danger-arctic-melt-and-how-save-our-world-whitley-strieber) habitable place for humans. This loss in Arctic outweighs the benefits of access to resources.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.6.2.1.6.1.1. Con: The melting Arctic brings benefits aside access to resources. Former ice deserts transform into fertile regions, e.g. in Greenland there is an [agricultural boom](http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/greenland-reaps-benefits-of-global-warming-8555241.html).
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.6.2.2. Pro: If there were not enough for everybody, there would not be so many people living on planet Earth.  If there weren't enough, people would die.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.6.2.2.1. Con: Some 795 million people in the world do not have [enough food](https://www.wfp.org/hunger/stats) to lead a healthy active life. That is about one in nine people on earth.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.6.2.2.2. Con: In developing countries 12.9% of the population is [undernourished](https://www.wfp.org/hunger/stats).
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.6.2.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.3.1.2.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.6.2.2.4. Con: In the Third World a lot of people are continuously [dying](http://freethoughtblogs.com/taslima/2012/06/21/six-million-children-die-of-hunger-every-year/) of starvation.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.6.2.2.4.1. Pro: Poor nutrition causes nearly half \(45%\) of deaths in children under five. That is [3.1 million children](https://www.wfp.org/hunger/stats) each year.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.6.2.2.4.2. Con: Despite starvation the population in the Third World is [increasing](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/aug/18/britishidentityandsociety.science). This indicates that there might be starvation but overall food supplies are sufficient to enable population growth.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.6.2.2.4.3. Con: Starvation in the Third World is not caused by insufficient food production but by [local factors](http://borgenproject.org/causes-hunger-africa/), such as a lack of infrastructure, poverty, gender inequality and HIV.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.6.2.3. Pro: [Agricultural biotechnology](http://www.acton.org/pub/commentary/2002/04/22/promise-biotechnology) may soon contribute to nutrition, hunger, and poverty alleviation around the world by extending ripening times, topsoil conversation, or adding vitamin A to rice.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.5. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.1.1.5.4.6.
1.1.1.2.1.1.5.6. Pro: Waste production and over-consumption by wealthy nations is causing the problems; not overpopulation.
1.1.1.2.1.1.6. Pro: Human overpopulation is among the reasons for the so called [sixth mass extinction](http://www.endangeredspeciesinternational.org/overview.html).
1.1.2. Pro: Poverty is linked to political instability. Thus, helping to eradicate poverty helps to create stability and prevent war.
1.1.2.1. Con: Extreme poverty and even starvation does not lead to political instability, as the example of [North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korean_famine) in the 1990s illustrates.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Eight out of ten of the poorest countries experienced large scale violence \([Stewart, p.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1122271/)\).
1.1.2.3. Pro: Intra-state fighting becomes attractive only when economic opportunities are unequal \([Stewart, p. 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1122271/pdf/342.pdf)\).
1.1.2.4. Pro: Poverty fuels the feeling that the social contract is being violated and therefore makes rebellions more likely.
1.1.2.5. Pro: Scarcity of resources, such as [water](http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198297390.001.0001/acprof-9780198297390-chapter-5), has the potential to induce conflict.
1.1.3. Con: Personal "return on investment" should not be a guide on charity.
1.1.3.1. Con: Receiving a benefit while helping others is not morally wrong. Otherwise all the foundations supported by big brands would be morally reprehensible.
1.1.3.2. Pro: The selfish pursuit of profit is at odds with the selfless aspects of charity.
1.1.3.3. Con: Making 'return on investment' the guide for charity decisions can lead to benefits for both parties, the donor as well as the receiver. Instead of helping gorillas, [microcredits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcredit) do support starving children and at the same time make the donor better off.
1.1.4. Pro: Children who grow up without worrying about their nutrition have time and energy to solve their society's other problems and develop new ideas, concepts and theories, which are capable of pushing mankind's progress.
1.1.5. Con: The saved children could have a destructive impact and cause suffering, while gorillas do not have this potential.
1.1.5.1. Con: Crime rates and poverty are [related](http://www.poverties.org/blog/poverty-and-crime). Thus, eradicating poverty reduces crime.
1.2. Con: Eradicating human starvation helps best to protect gorillas because ultimately, human poverty represents the [biggest threat](http://gorillafund.org/programs/threats) to gorillas. This makes donations to gorillas a worse option.
1.2.1. Pro: In Central African countries, the consumption of [bushmeat](https://www.iucn.org/content/extinction-crisis-escalates-red-list-shows-apes-corals-vultures-dolphins-all-danger), including the meat of gorillas is widespread. One reason is that a part of the population cannot afford food otherwise. Helping these locals solves at least a part of this problem and, in the end, helps the gorillas as well.
1.2.2. Con: Gorillas are likely to be extinct before starvation is cured.
1.2.2.1. Con: The [Millennium Development Goals](http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/poverty.shtml) on eradicating extreme poverty were met five years ahead of schedule. This indicates that an end to starvation can be achieved fairly quickly if importance is assigned to it.
1.2.2.2. Pro: The International Union for Conservation of Nature \([IUCN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla#Evolution_and_classification)\) lists gorilla species as endangered or critically endangered.
1.2.2.2.1. Pro: The total [population](http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/endangered_species/great_apes/gorillas/) of mountain gorillas is around 880 individuals.
1.2.2.2.2. Con: Listing the Western Lowland Gorilla as 'critically endangered' violates the [criteria](http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical-documents/categories-and-criteria/2001-categories-criteria) the IUCN set for their classification as the [rationale](http://www.iucn.org/content/extinction-crisis-escalates-red-list-shows-apes-corals-vultures-dolphins-all-danger) given does not match.
1.2.2.2.2.1. Con: If there are uncertainties, Annex 1 of the regulation allows for a deviation from the [rules](http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical-documents/categories-and-criteria/2001-categories-criteria).
1.2.2.2.2.1.1. Con: Annex 1 only allows for a deviation of rules in case of uncertain information. As the statement by IUCN is clear about the statistics, this uncertainty clause does not apply.
1.2.2.2.2.1.2. Con: Uncertainty data would still need to fulfill the general criteria of what constitutes 'critically endangered'. Even if the cited statistics are uncertainty numbers they do not fulfill the criteria.
1.2.2.2.2.2. Pro: According to the IUCN's [statement](http://www.iucn.org/content/extinction-crisis-escalates-red-list-shows-apes-corals-vultures-dolphins-all-danger) gorillas are 'critically endangered' because their population has declined by more than 60% over the last 20-25 years. Yet, in the [criteria](http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical-documents/categories-and-criteria/2001-categories-criteria) it needs at least a population decline of 80% within 10 years or at least three generations to be counted as 'critically endangered'.
1.2.2.2.2.2.1. Pro: The statement matches the criteria's assessment of '[endangered](http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical-documents/categories-and-criteria/2001-categories-criteria)' \(and not 'critically endangered' as claimed\) which requires "an observed, estimated, inferred or suspected population size reduction of ≥50% over the last 10 years or three generations".
1.3. Pro: There are a sufficient number of actors responsible for and capable of taking care of children, while there are far fewer for gorillas.
1.3.1. Con: Governments created national parks. Thus, they are clearly helping to protect gorillas.
1.3.2. Pro: The biggest animal-based charities have [annual revenues](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jackie-fuchs/why-we-give-to-animal-cha_b_188773.html) of only a small percentage of those of the largest charities in the U.S., like Food for the Poor or the American Red Cross.
1.3.2.1. Con: Donations to animal charities outweigh those to human centered causes. Oxfam, for [example](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/donkeys-left-more-money-war-6814058), receives less than the donkey sanctuary in Britain. Adding gorillas to the list of cats, dogs, and garden birds as target of donations makes the imbalance worse.
1.3.2.2. Pro: In 2006, [Food for the Poor](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jackie-fuchs/why-we-give-to-animal-cha_b_188773.html) had revenues of $1 billion while the two most high profile animal welfare organizations in the U.S., the Humane Society of the United States \(HSUS\) and The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals \(ASPCA\), reported revenues of approximately $100 million and $75 million.
1.3.3. Con: The question is to know what is the ratio of organisations per children or gorilla. Given the fact that starving children outnumber by far gorillas, it seems logical to also dedicate more resources to them.
1.4. Pro: Humans are the source of gorilla extinction and thus carry a unique responsibility for saving them.
1.4.1. Pro: [Threats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla) to their survival include habitat destruction and poaching.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Habitat destruction leads to isolation and thus to limitation of diversity in gorillas' [genetic material](http://www.berggorilla.org/en/gorillas/threats-protection/).
1.4.2. Con: Humans do carry responsibility for the extinction of many [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Species_made_extinct_by_human_activities) but did not react by donating for them. Gorillas do not represent a special case here.
1.4.2.1. Con: Because gorillas are [genetically](http://www.livescience.com/18892-gorillas-humans-gene-sequence.html) very close to humans they are valuable for research on human behavior and evolution.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: The study of gorillas is useful as contribution to scientific theory in general \([Steklis, p. 138](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=nChI1zPpZG8C&pg=PA136&lpg=PA136&dq=benefits+of+studying+gorillas&source=bl&ots=3OrAlsI_1R&sig=lp3ztRJtm0ljEufEWziWkdRpO9k&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwju5bXh5fLPAhWHpJQKHWyKAL0Q6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&q=benefits%20of%20studying%20gorillas&f=false)\).
1.4.2.1.1.1. Con: The study of every animal can be considered as being useful to scientific theory in general as it provides one more case of possible falsification.
1.4.2.1.2. Pro: Humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, and the large apes of Africa share a common ancestor. Understanding differences in trajectory helps understand humankind's path.
1.4.2.1.3. Pro: To explore if humans are peace-loving or inherently aggressive in their natural state, the study of gorillas is crucial. The study of the two other close cousins, the chimpanzees and the bonobos, yielded contradictory results.
1.4.2.1.3.1. Pro: The study of [chimpanzees](http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.anthro.32.061002.120046?journalCode=anthro) as violent by nature shows that humans have a direct lineage to raiding enemy territory for millions of years.
1.4.2.1.3.2. Pro: The extremely peaceful [Bonobos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Natured) are a candidate to illustrate the human mind in its natural state.
1.4.3. Con: Just as humans kill each gorillas are a threat to each other too.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Gorillas are a threat to themselves, as they contribute to their own decline through [infanticide](http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/06/the-biggest-threats-to-gorillas-cincinnati-zoo-not-included/). When a dominant male dies, the successor will often kill all his offspring.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: The rate of infanticide among gorillas is 1.7%. That is of barely any statistical significance when talking about factors which endanger the gorilla population.
1.4.3.1.2. Pro: Infanticide is a major, costly problem when [introducing bred gorillas into the wild](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNKemcv4i6g). My guess is that the issue is less severe \(1.7%\) when born in the wild \(since they are already adapted to their surroundings\).
1.4.4. Con: Humans are the [reason](http://www.borgenmagazine.com/5-common-causes-starvation/) for starving children, too. The 'causation justification' can therefore not be crucial.
1.4.5. Pro: Gorillas cannot save themselves from extinction and need our help to stay alive.
1.4.5.1. Con: Every day, [other](http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/biodiversity/biodiversity/) animal species that cannot save themselves are going extinct. There is no reason why gorillas should be of special concern.
1.4.5.1.1. Pro: This has always been the case, new species arise and other ones go extinct. It is called natural selection.
1.4.5.1.1.1. Con: Human activity is [responsible](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/05/140529-conservation-science-animals-species-endangered-extinction/) for an accelerated extinction of countless species that have been called the [sixth mass extinction](http://www.endangeredspeciesinternational.org/overview.html) on par with the asteroid that eliminated most dinosaurs.
1.4.5.1.2. Con: Many people are concerned about the loss of biodiversity and make donations to organisations that support wildlife.
1.4.5.1.2.1. Pro: If people were not concerned, organisations such as [WWF](http://www.worldwildlife.org/), [Greenpeace](http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/about/), [WCS](https://www.wcs.org/) etc. would not be as famous, popular and successful as they are.
1.4.5.1.2.2. Con: Donations for biodiversity preservation are usually not targeted at individual species.
1.4.5.1.2.2.1. Pro: The single biggest source of species decimation over the coming decades is climate change. Donating money to stop it is a more efficient way to address the loss in biodiversity.
1.4.5.1.2.2.2. Pro: It is much more effective to keep many easier to sustain species alive instead of focusing on one difficult to sustain species, like gorillas.
1.4.5.1.2.3. Con: Next to nobody is worrying that we are losing some [millipedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doratogonus), [spiders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poecilotheria_hanumavilasumica) or [snails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partula_langfordi).
1.4.5.1.2.3.1. Con: [Crowdfunding](http://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/save-our-spider) to save local spiders was very efficient and reached its target fast. This indicates that once offered with an opportunity to care about spiders, people actually do worry and even get actively involved.
1.4.5.1.2.3.1.1. Con: Them having done a successful campaign with 472 supporters means that there is very little interest in it, not that there is very much interest.
1.4.5.1.2.3.2. Con: There are NGOs that work to preserve insects that are marginal in appearance, such as [Buglife](https://www.buglife.org.uk/), [BWARS](http://www.bwars.com/), or [Xerces](http://www.xerces.org/).
1.4.5.1.2.3.3. Con: The Bronx Zoo runs an annual "[name a roach](https://bronxzoo.com/roach)" fundraiser.
1.4.5.1.2.4. Con: Despite the fact that between [1 - 300 species](http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/biodiversity/biodiversity/) go extinct every day, there do not seem to be many people protesting it.
1.4.5.1.2.5. Con: Humans are not even able to [save](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/10/great-barrier-reef-terminal-stage-australia-scientists-despair-latest-coral-bleaching-data) the Great Barrier Reef, a major tourist attraction, unique in the world, where the threat to it has long been known and documented.
1.4.5.1.3. Con: Scientists are dealing with species extinction by doing research and working on better ways to combat/slow extinctions by [mobilizing](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/05/140529-conservation-science-animals-species-endangered-extinction/) millions of people around the world.
1.4.5.1.4. Pro: Many endangered species are much cheaper to "save" than gorillas and more useful to humankind. They are therefore more relevant to care about.
1.4.5.1.4.1. Con: It is morally wrong to asses a species’ worth only based on how expensive or inexpensive the actions to save that species are.
1.4.5.1.4.2. Pro: Some species have more value to the ecosystem than others. For example, several researchers \(including Albert Einstein\) have warned that the extinction of [honeybees](http://www.globalresearch.ca/death-and-extinction-of-the-bees/5375684) could have terrible consequences for the environment and could potentially cause the human race to go extinct.
1.4.5.2. Pro: Even if there are children in need, unlike gorillas, humans have [put](https://aifs.gov.au/cfca/publications/history-child-protection-services) a [system](https://aifs.gov.au/cfca/publications/international-approaches-child-protection/international-examples-child-protection) in place to make sure [infants](https://www.unicef.org/protection/) are looked after.
1.4.5.2.1. Pro: Children are the future of society. Accordingly their members must intensively take care of them in order to maintain society, considering that its continuance is good for every member.
1.4.5.2.1.1. Pro: Gorillas will not pay old people's retirement pension or look after them.
1.4.5.2.1.2. Con: Animal children are the future of animal societies. No society is intrinsically more valuable than another.
1.4.5.2.1.3. Con: The future of a society is not threatened if starvation persists.
1.4.5.2.1.3.1. Pro: There was much starvation in Europe in the past but it transformed without the help from outside.
1.4.5.2.1.4. Pro: Future societies play a central role in maintaining the human race.
1.4.5.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.
1.4.5.2.3. Pro: Article 19 of the [UN Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_protection) on the Rights of the Child provides for the protection of children.
1.4.5.2.4. Pro: Governments introduced and implemented dedicated child protection programs.
1.4.5.2.4.1. Pro: Since 1962 there is a nation-wide Child Protective Service in the USA to meet the service needs of all reported cases of child neglect, abuse and exploitation \([Myers, p. 462](https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publishing/insights_law_society/ChildProtectionHistory.authcheckdam.pdf)\).
1.4.5.2.4.2. Pro: [Germany](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/child-rights/germany.php) provides health care for virtually all children who reside in the country, as well as a social welfare coverage. To ensure these rights, various forms of assistance are granted to children.
1.4.5.2.4.3. Con: Although this is true for developed countries, there are still many states, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, that do not respect and protect the [Rights of the Child](http://www.humanium.org/en/rcri-world-ranking-by-countries/).
1.4.5.3. Con: But humans save gorillas, and if you teach little children to grow up loving gorillas, you'd have a new generation loving gorillas, that makes gorilla extinction much more impossible.
1.4.5.4. Con: Starving children cannot help themselves either.
1.4.5.5. Con: Gorillas face threats so grave that donations will not help their chances of survival. Thus, efforts should be focused on starving children.
1.4.5.5.1. Pro: [Chinese timber demand](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/01/100324-gorillas-extinct-africa-un-report/) is taking a heavy toll on gorillas' chances for future existence. The impact of this demand would not be outweighed by some token donations.
1.4.5.5.2. Pro: Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, the countries in which gorillas live, have been politically unstable in the last decades and still are. These [conflicts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_gorilla) not only threaten humans, but also gorillas.
1.4.5.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.1.
1.4.5.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.
1.4.5.5.5. Con: "Dont try, you will fail anyway" is not a valid argument or a healthy mentality toward problem solving.
1.4.5.5.6. Con: The children saved from starvation will in turn have more children who will be starving as well, increasing the problem over time.
1.4.5.5.6.1. Con: Children saved from starvation can get access to education and hence pass it down to their children. Education brings work, which brings money which also brings food and thus ends starvation.
1.4.5.5.7. Pro: The [Ebola virus](https://www.thedodo.com/gorilla-ebola-chimpanzee-958823298.html) killed one third of the total gorilla population. Humans could not do anything about it.
1.4.5.5.7.1. Con: The [same source](https://www.thedodo.com/gorilla-ebola-chimpanzee-958823298.html) emphasizes that the true impact of Ebola is unclear, and that the researchers who warn of its impact still regard humans as the greatest threat to gorillas. Donations can thus still have an impact on gorillas' survival chances.
1.4.5.5.7.2. Con: If the gorilla population was not so decimated because of human influence, then the Ebola virus would have been a lesser threat to gorillas' existence \(because of the larger number of gorillas overall\). So even though humans are not responsible for Ebola, they are responsible for the existential threat this poses to gorillas.
1.4.5.5.7.3. Con: Gorillas can be [vaccinated](https://www.thedodo.com/community/SuraneON/ebola-vaccine-for-mountain-gor-775314440.html) against Ebola.
1.4.5.5.7.3.1. Pro: The first [trials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RVSV-ZEBOV_vaccine) of Ebola vaccines look very promising.
1.4.5.5.8. Con: The Great Apes Survival Partnership \([GRASP](http://www.un-grasp.org/)\) is a project of United Nations Environment Programme \(UNEP\) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization \(UNESCO\) that seeks to ensure the survival of the world's great ape species including all four gorilla species. They believe gorillas can be saved from extinction.
1.4.5.5.9. Con: The population of mountain gorillas is known to be [increasing](http://gorillafund.org/programs/threats) due to the intense conservation efforts of the Fossey Fund, local park authorities, and other partners. Between 1989 and 2003 the Virunga mountain gorilla population increased by 17%. By 2010, the population had grown by another 26.3%.
1.4.6. Con: -> See 1.4.5.5.7.
1.5. Con: Donation is a waste of money on the part of the donor. It is a financial loss with negligible personal return.
1.5.1. Con: Lack of personal gain is the core belief behind philanthropy, otherwise it is simply investment.
1.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.1.1.
1.7. Con: -> See 1.4.5.5.
1.8. Pro: Gorillas are in danger of extinction whereas human children are not.
1.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.
1.8.2. Con: Numerically speaking, gorillas are not at the brink of extinction.
1.8.2.1. Pro: There are around [100,000](http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/endangered_species/great_apes/gorillas/) Western Lowland gorillas. These are definitely not on the brink of extinction. Yet, gorilla-supporting organizations do also channel funds to them.
1.8.2.1.1. Con: The International Union for Conservation of Nature \([IUCN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List)\) lists the Western Lowland gorilla as critically endangered, therefore they face an "extremely high risk of extinction in the wild".
1.8.2.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.2.
1.8.2.2. Con: There are just [880](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_gorilla) individual Mountain Gorillas left on the entire planet. There are at least some species that are threatened to the point of near extinction.
1.8.2.3. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.
1.8.3. Con: Children in societies that starve are facing threats to their existence.
1.8.3.1. Pro: Children are affected by poverty and malnutrition beyond average and therefore in need for help and support.
1.8.3.1.1. Pro: In 2014, about [16%](http://www.sos-usa.org/our-impact/childrens-statistics#sthash.Hyhfs773.dpuf) of children in developing regions were underweight.
1.8.3.1.2. Pro: There are [62.8 million](http://www.sos-usa.org/our-impact/childrens-statistics) children worldwide who suffer from acute malnutrition.
1.8.3.1.3. Pro: Nearly [half](http://www.sos-usa.org/our-impact/childrens-statistics) of all deaths in children under five years of age are attributable to malnutrition, that accounts for about 3 million deaths a year.
1.8.3.1.4. Pro: Children represent almost [half](http://www.berggorilla.org/en/gorillas/general/ecology/articles-ecology/seed-dispersal-by-western-lowland-gorillas-from-fruits-to-seedlings/) of all people living in extreme poverty although they make up roughly a third of the world’s population.
1.8.4. Con: Children in starving societies are unlikely to rescue themselves.
1.8.5. Pro: Parents are in a position to improve the future for their children while gorillas are not.
1.8.5.1. Pro: Many societies lifted themselves out of poverty, like [China](https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2015/aug/19/china-poverty-inequality-development-goals) or [South Korea](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11295902-the-korean-state-and-social-policy).
1.8.5.1.1. Con: The [Chinese](https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2015/aug/19/china-poverty-inequality-development-goals) still suffer from poverty in rural and interior regions. Eradicating poverty completely is very difficult for a society to achieve completely.
1.8.5.2. Pro: In all societies, even starving ones, there are some people that are better off. Parents can reach this position.
1.8.5.3. Pro: Parents generally do all they can to keep their children alive and well fed.
1.8.5.3.1. Con: In 2008, the U.S. state and local Child Protective Services \(CPS\) received 3.3 million reports of children being abused or neglected. 71% of the children were classified as victims of [child neglect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_neglect), which means there was a deficit in meeting a child's basic needs, including the failure to provide nutrition.
1.8.5.3.2. Con: Not all parents take good care of their children: some parents [sell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child-selling) their [children](https://qz.com/525900/child-trafficking-in-china-often-starts-with-parents-selling-their-own-kids/) \(for [exploitative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trafficking_of_children) or non-exploitative reasons\), [prostitute](http://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2013/12/world/cambodia-child-sex-trade/) them or sell them to trafficking rings.
1.8.5.3.2.1. Con: Most parents that participate in those painful practices do it out of real necessity, as they have no means to support neither their children nor themselves.
1.8.5.3.3. Pro: The [human brain](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/02/080226213448.htm) reacts to the image of an infant's face and, that reaction is probably  responsible for the adult’s instinct to care and protect a baby.
1.8.5.4. Con: Due to conditions such as drought and poverty, parents may not be able to feed their own children even if they want to.
1.8.5.5. Pro: Unlike gorillas, human parents are able to ask their community/government for help in providing food for their children.
1.8.5.5.1. Con: In the countries with more starving people, it is the lack of resources, not the unwillingness of the government to help, which produces that situation. Thus, parents cannot ask for help.
1.8.5.5.2. Pro: Aside from governments and communities, humans can also count on international [organisations](https://hungermath.wordpress.com/world-hunger-organizations-list/) that fight against hunger.
1.8.5.5.2.1. Con: These organizations depend on funding in order to fight hunger. They may lose this funding if people reallocate their donations to gorilla organizations.
1.8.5.5.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.
1.8.5.6. Con: There are roughly [140 million orphans](http://www.sos-usa.org/our-impact/childrens-statistics) without any parental guardians. Those children need help and support from different sources.
1.8.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.2.
1.8.7. Con: Every species should be primarily responsible for taking care of members of their own species. Normally, in the more advanced species, this is done by parents or herds. Thus gorillas should take care of themselves. If they do not or cannot, then their extinction is justified.
1.8.7.1. Con: This argument commits the [naturalistic fallacy](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-non-naturalism/#NatFal). That is, it moves from a descriptive claim \(that species tend to look to their own wellbeing\) to a normative one \(that they should\).
1.8.7.2. Con: For virtually all moral theorists, only humans have [moral agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_agency). It is therefore wrong to impute moral obligation to gorillas to take care of themselves.
1.8.7.3. Con: This suggestion makes no sense. If gorillas were to carry arms and shoot the humans that endangered them, would that then make them more worthy of saving as they had taken care of members of their own species?
1.8.8. Con: A human child that might starve to death is by definition in danger of extinction.
1.8.8.1. Con: The moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the last individual of the species.
1.8.9. Pro: Humans are already at unsustainable population numbers. Saving starving children would only compound any local ecological problem derived from overpopulation. Gorillas are not threatened because of unsustainable population numbers but due to human encroachment. That means money can be spent effectively on saving gorillas. Saving starving children only makes more starving children in the future, as shown by Thomas Malthus. [Malthusian Trap.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusian_trap)
1.8.10. Con: Preservation of a given species is not an intrinsic good.
1.8.11. Pro: Human children are not hunted by another armed species, whereas gorillas are.
1.8.11.1. Con: Children are in an even worse position as it is armed members of their own species that kill them.
1.8.11.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.3.
1.8.11.2. Con: This is irrelevant. Both children and gorillas are facing threats. Whether or not those threats come from other species ultimately doesn't matter.
1.9. Pro: Donating for gorillas comes with beneficial side effects for humankind.
1.9.1. Con: Those living close to gorillas suffer from starvation. Apparently they do not profit from donations to them.
1.9.1.1. Con: The [Virunga National Park](http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2014/11/07/362084196/how-africas-first-national-park-can-benefit-both-gorillas-and-locals) in the Democratic Republic of Congo claims to create about 100,000 new jobs in the next three to six years, mainly on the 2 million acres park-owned property.
1.9.1.2. Pro: The [Karamoja region](http://www.irinnews.org/report/78352/uganda-food-crisis-starvation-northeast) in Uganda close to the gorilla park is facing a food crisis.
1.9.1.3. Pro: The Rwandan districts of [Nyanza and Gisagara](https://medium.com/\@dhimbara/while-the-kagames-live-like-kings-and-queens-thousands-of-rwandans-are-starving-and-fleeing-to-20972baafca2#.oqxblqaqc) are close to national parks and are among those hit most severely by starvation in the country.
1.9.2. Con: Gorilla preservation takes place in small and irrelevant national parks. Any effect will be local at best and not for humankind at large.
1.9.2.1. Pro: The Congo is pretty much [covered](http://rainforests.mongabay.com/congo/) by rain forest. Losing the small fraction of it in which gorillas live will not change the course of humankind.
1.9.2.2. Pro: Gorillas mainly live in national parks, such as the [Volcanoes Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanoes_National_Park) or the [Mghinga Park](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mgahinga-Gorilla-Nationalpark). These are protected areas already. Thus, gorilla donations do not add to habitat protection that is useful for humans.
1.9.2.2.1. Pro: NGOs, such as [Gorilla Doctors](http://www.gorilladoctors.org/), mainly work with the Eastern Gorillas that are in those parks.
1.9.2.2.2. Con: [Gorillas](http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/lowland-gorilla/) do live in the unprotected wild as well.
1.9.2.3. Con: -> See 1.9.2.2.2.
1.9.3. Pro: Humans share similar genetic material with gorillas. Supporting the survival of gorillas can thus help us learn \(more\) about our origin.
1.9.4. Con: Donations that support gorillas are less effective in helping humans or the environment than donations that support those causes. Thus by donating to organizations that support gorillas, one is not helping them as much as one could.
1.9.4.1. Pro: Logically speaking, if organisations that support gorillas were the best way to support humans, then the organisations that are dedicated to helping humans would, instead of directly helping the suffering humans, help gorillas, as this would be the best use of their funds. But this is not the case.
1.9.4.2. Pro: There are much more effective investments to save the environment than saving gorillas and their habitat. Examples are the [Greenpeace Fund](http://www.greenpeacefund.org/), the [Rainforest Alliance](http://www.rainforest-alliance.org/de) or the [Union of Concerned Scientists](http://www.ucsusa.org/).
1.9.5. Con: The extinction of gorillas creates net positive effects for humans.
1.9.5.1. Pro: If gorillas are extinct they are eliminated as a reservoir of dangerous diseases, such as [yaws](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3840862/) or [malaria parasites](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/01/100119133517.htm).
1.9.5.2. Pro: Gorillas are a potential threat to locals.
1.9.5.2.1. Pro: Gorillas raid local farmers' fields and often destroy the [entire harvest](http://www.berggorilla.org/en/gorillas/general/habitat/why-are-gorillas-threatened/).
1.9.5.2.2. Con: Gorillas are generally not violent and when they are, it is mostly towards [other](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160531-how-violent-are-gorillas-really) gorillas.
1.9.5.2.3. Con: Gorillas need to be [provoked](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160531-how-violent-are-gorillas-really) in order to attack, so in the instances where gorillas have harmed humans, the latter were to blame according to experts,.
1.9.5.2.3.1. Pro: A dominant gorilla will first display [threats](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160531-how-violent-are-gorillas-really) and only when the other animal or person refuses to back down, will the gorilla will attack.
1.9.5.2.4. Pro: There have been cases of gorillas attacking humans in nature.
1.9.5.2.4.1. Con: Gorillas only attack humans with special professions, such as [poachers](http://www.bbc.co.uk/earth/story/20160531-how-violent-are-gorillas-really) or [trackers](http://jambo.africa.kyoto-u.ac.jp/kiroku/asm_suppl/abstracts/pdf/ASM_s39/5Ando.pdf).
1.9.5.2.4.2. Con: Although there is not a lot of research, gorilla attacks on humans are rare: a [review](http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/G03725.pdf) documents only three gorilla attacks before 2000.
1.9.5.2.4.2.1. Pro: The same document cites way more instances where humans have been dangerous to gorillas than the other way around.
1.9.5.2.4.3. Pro: A [2009 report](http://www.bbc.co.uk/earth/story/20160531-how-violent-are-gorillas-really) into conflict between humans and apes documents how a silverback male attacked a man in the Kagwene Gorilla Sanctuary in Cameroon.
1.9.5.2.4.4. Pro: Female Western Gorillas [frequently act aggressively towards humans](http://www.bbc.co.uk/earth/story/20160531-how-violent-are-gorillas-really), presumably because they were not used to their presence.
1.9.5.2.4.4.1. Con: The study in question actually singled out two females with juvenile young, as the main gorillas in a large group being observed over an extended period of time, that showed sustained aggression, which largely consisted of vocalisations, rather than physical contact. They also observed that the oldest male in the group began intervening to cut off the aggression towards the end of their observation period. \([Ando et. al., p. 64](http://jambo.africa.kyoto-u.ac.jp/kiroku/asm_suppl/abstracts/pdf/ASM_s39/5Ando.pdf)\)
1.9.5.2.4.4.1.1. Pro: Indeed, based on the differences in male and female gorilla aggression observed in their study versus other similar ones, the main conclusion the authors draw is that dynamics can vary from gorilla family to gorilla family. \([Ando et. al., p. 65](http://jambo.africa.kyoto-u.ac.jp/kiroku/asm_suppl/abstracts/pdf/ASM_s39/5Ando.pdf)\)
1.9.5.2.4.5. Pro: There have been [cases](http://www.bbc.co.uk/earth/story/20160531-how-violent-are-gorillas-really) where gorillas attacked and even killed humans, mainly because the locals did not know how to correctly act in front of gorillas.
1.9.5.2.4.5.1. Pro: In some cases, running away from a gorilla, [instead](http://www.berggorilla.org/en/gorillas/general/habitat/are-gorillas-dangerous-to-people/) of submissively crouching down and looking at the ground, can cause the gorilla to chase and bite. Therefore, a human that doesn’t know anything about gorillas can be hurt, even if said person was not trying to do anything wrong.
1.9.5.2.4.5.2. Con: Those [incidents](http://www.bbc.co.uk/earth/story/20160531-how-violent-are-gorillas-really) are rare.
1.9.5.3. Con: Gorilla tourism increased the overall [safety level of Rwanda](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/AFRICAEXT/Resources/258643-1271798012256/Tourism_Rwanda.pdf) through training of police and army.
1.9.6. Pro: Donating for gorillas benefits the local population.
1.9.6.1. Pro: The Mgahinga Gorilla National Park covers the lands of the indigenous [Batwa](http://www.ugandawildlife.org/explore-our-parks/parks-by-name-a-z/mgahinga-gorilla-national-park/activities/item/85-cultural-encounters-in-mgnp). Therefore, the protection of gorillas safeguards the continued existence of this old tribe.
1.9.6.1.1. Con: Gorilla protection efforts interfere with indigenous cultures.
1.9.6.1.1.1. Pro: Protecting habitats and banning poaching has lead to [indigenous](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/28/exiles-human-cost-of-conservation-indigenous-peoples-eco-tourism) people being evicted from their lands, in some cases even violently.
1.9.6.1.1.2. Pro: Even if most experts recognise that some of the most biologically rich areas are [managed](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jun/03/yosemite-conservation-indigenous-people) by indigenous people, and that they do a good job, some governments and activists still advocate to evict them.
1.9.6.1.1.3. Pro: Conservation action in Cameroon, Gabon, the Central African Republic or the Democratic Republic of Congo has caused human rights [abuses](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/28/exiles-human-cost-of-conservation-indigenous-peoples-eco-tourism) while the number of gorillas is still decreasing considerably.
1.9.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.9.5.3.
1.9.6.3. Con: The local population in Rwanda and Congo that are potential beneficiaries of gorilla support are only a tiny fraction of humankind.
1.9.6.4. Con: The economic benefits local communities receive as side-effect from gorillas are marginal.
1.9.6.4.1. Pro: Local communities in Uganda receive only [5%](http://www.igcp.org/wp-content/themes/igcp/docs/pdf/MoyiniUganda.pdf) of gorilla tourist expenditures on food, some accommodation, drinks and crafts as well as [20%](http://www.igcp.org/wp-content/themes/igcp/docs/pdf/MoyiniUganda.pdf) of entrance fees. Therefore local communities do not benefit substantially.
1.9.6.4.2. Pro: Employment for locals is marginal as only [946 people](http://www.igcp.org/wp-content/themes/igcp/docs/pdf/MoyiniUganda.pdf) are employed in the total Ugandan gorilla industry. Likewise Rwandan national parks only employ [180 local](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/AFRICAEXT/Resources/258643-1271798012256/Tourism_Rwanda.pdf) people.
1.9.6.4.3. Con: Protecting gorillas means that you protect tourism and thus the livelihood of people who live in that area. As the habitat of gorillas is located in countries like Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda, which are the poorest regions on earth, the donations help prevent children from starving.
1.9.6.4.3.1. Pro: Gorilla permit fees account for [83.2%](http://www.igcp.org/wp-content/themes/igcp/docs/pdf/MoyiniUganda.pdf) of all park revenues in Uganda. Without gorilla tourism these parks could not be maintained.
1.9.6.4.3.2. Con: Too much tourism is [destroying](https://www.gdrc.org/uem/eco-tour/envi/one.html) habitats.
1.9.6.4.3.3. Pro: The [annual revenue](http://igcp.org/gorillas/tourism/) earned directly from gorilla tourism is an important component of funding conservation and management of the parks, as well as local and national economies.
1.9.6.4.3.4. Pro: In [Rwanda](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/AFRICAEXT/Resources/258643-1271798012256/Tourism_Rwanda.pdf) revenues from gorilla tourism provide funds to the national parks and facilitate conservation activities.
1.9.6.4.3.5. Pro: Rwanda's foreign earnings from tourism, which are mainly created by gorilla-related tourism, are expected to rise to [$600 million](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/AFRICAEXT/Resources/258643-1271798012256/Tourism_Rwanda.pdf) by 2020.
1.9.6.4.4. Pro: Investments in local facilities are mainly designed for tourists, such as the [Sabyinyo Silverback Lodge](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/AFRICAEXT/Resources/258643-1271798012256/Tourism_Rwanda.pdf), and do not help locals immediately.
1.9.6.4.4.1. Pro: The lodge is partly run by gorilla conversation NGOs but the operator is a [private company](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/AFRICAEXT/Resources/258643-1271798012256/Tourism_Rwanda.pdf) that only pays a fee of $50 per night while charging $400 to $1000. Thus, only a small amount of money arrives to local communities.
1.9.6.4.4.2. Pro: Only [45 people](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/AFRICAEXT/Resources/258643-1271798012256/Tourism_Rwanda.pdf) are employed at the lodge which contrasts with the 300,000 living close to the gorilla park.
1.9.6.4.5. Pro: In Rwanda only [5%](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/AFRICAEXT/Resources/258643-1271798012256/Tourism_Rwanda.pdf) of revenues from national parks are shared with local communities. Gorillas represent [85%](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/AFRICAEXT/Resources/258643-1271798012256/Tourism_Rwanda.pdf) of revenues created for these parks.
1.9.6.4.6. Con: In Rwanda [10 schools](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/AFRICAEXT/Resources/258643-1271798012256/Tourism_Rwanda.pdf) have been built in the vicinity of the national park financed by revenues from gorilla tourism.
1.9.6.4.7. Con: In Rwanda, [32 water tanks](http://32 water tanks were constructed after 2005 with 25,000 litre tanks) were constructed from gorilla tourism revenues. These provide easy access to water for local communities.
1.9.6.5. Pro: Many conservation organizations work with local people to increase not only the wellbeing of wild animals, but the well being of the local humans too. People that live more comfortably and have access to adequate resources are more likely to care about the local environment and animals in it.
1.9.6.5.1. Pro: The IUCN is a well-known conservation organization that has a specialist group dedicated to the [health and well-being of indigenous people](https://www.iucn.org/theme/protected-areas/wcpa/what-we-do/health-and-well-being-0). They also have a specialist group dedicated to [gender-equality,](https://www.iucn.org/press/IUCN-experts/gender) which in turn helps out children.
1.9.6.5.2. Pro: WWF is also involved in both [gender-equality](https://www.worldwildlife.org/initiatives/empower-women-and-improve-health) and family planning and also bettering [indigenous](https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/empowering-women-and-families-to-build-healthy-communities-and-a-healthy-planet) people's health.
1.9.6.6. Con: Gorillas are endangered from humans because humans need/want resources that the Gorillas or Gorilla habitats can provide.  By donating to help humans they are less likely to exploit Gorillas or their habitat
1.9.6.7. Pro: Donations for gorillas lead to an improvement of life for local farmers as the habitat protection efforts will benefit them directly, e.g. by providing [improved cooking stoves](http://www.gorillas.org/Project/Detail/Firewood_Saving_Stoves).
1.9.6.7.1. Pro: Impoverished [children](http://www.gorillas.org/Project/Detail/Firewood_Saving_Stoves) are often involved in time consuming collection of firewood from habitats. Enhancing the efficiency of stoves helps these children.
1.9.6.7.2. Pro: Better stoves improve the [health](http://www.gorillas.org/Project/Detail/Firewood_Saving_Stoves) of local families as the smoke in living huts is reduced.
1.9.6.8. Con: Donations for starving children will help those working in areas related to starvation prevention. There are many more people working on this problem.
1.9.6.8.1. Pro: The logistics dimension of the [World Food Program](https://www.wfp.org/logistics) is impressive and in itself needs at least 6,000 employees.
1.9.6.9. Con: Supporting gorilla businesses through tourism doesn't actually help the animals because it exploits them and puts them in danger.
1.9.6.9.1. Pro: Tourism is actually a [threat to gorillas](http://www.volcanoesnationalparkrwanda.com/about/is-gorilla-tourism-encourage-mountain-gorilla-conservation.html), as the tourists can infect the animals with influenza, tuberculosis, and diarrhea. These diseases are fatal for gorillas as their immune system can hardly fight the germs.
1.9.6.9.2. Con: NGOs, such as the [International Gorilla Conservation Programme](http://igcp.org/gorillas/tourism/), do argue that tourism and preservation are linked and 'neither has a future without the other'. This means parks cannot survive without tourism and thus integral to the aim of helping gorillas.
1.9.7. Pro: Organizations supporting gorillas usually fight against habitat destruction and an intact environment will benefit humans \(and thus starving children\) as well.
1.9.7.1. Pro: Gorillas are more important to the ecosystems of the regions they live in than human children. Thus making donations to organizations that support gorillas benefits the environment in those regions for all of humankind.
1.9.7.1.1. Con: Starvation causes more damage to the ecosystem than dying gorillas. This makes hungry human children, as agents of starvation, more important than gorillas for preservation efforts.
1.9.7.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.
1.9.7.1.1.2. Pro: In Zimbabwe, the [wildlife authorities](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/05/world/zimbabwe-kills-starving-elephants-for-food.html) had to kill thousands of elephants, impalas and other animals so starving people could survive.
1.9.7.1.1.3. Pro: Hunger is the main reason why people, e.g. in [Brazil's Amazon area](http://radio.wpsu.org/post/amazons-fire-season-you-either-burn-or-you-starve), practice fire clearance, which destroys the native forest and releases huge amounts of greenhouse gases.
1.9.7.1.2. Con: Some gorilla species are nearly [extinct](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/01/100324-gorillas-extinct-africa-un-report/) and thus have only little remaining impact on the ecosystem as a whole.
1.9.7.1.3. Con: -> See 1.9.2.
1.9.7.1.4. Con: -> See 1.9.4.
1.9.7.1.5. Pro: Gorillas play a crucial role in local [biodiversity](http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/endangered_species/great_apes/gorillas/), as they roam through large territories and help spread and germinate the seeds of the fruit they consume.
1.9.7.1.5.1. Con: Gorillas are not the only tool of [seed dispersal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_dispersal). Other animals, the plants themselves or even wind do perform the same function.
1.9.7.1.5.1.1. Pro: If gorillas were not to eat the fruits, other animals would.
1.9.7.1.5.1.1.1. Pro: Other kinds of apes can spread the seeds.
1.9.7.1.5.1.1.2. Pro: The forests in which gorillas live do not die off when gorillas go extinct in these areas.
1.9.7.1.5.1.1.2.1. Pro: Gorillas feed off a very [limited](http://www.berggorilla.org/en/gorillas/general/everyday-life/what-do-gorillas-eat/) amount of food. Mountain Gorillas like 38 kinds of plants and Western Gorillas about 200, of the tens of thousands of plants in a rain forest.
1.9.7.1.5.1.1.3. Pro: The fruit would fall to the ground when overripe, where it would be eaten by other animals, like [hogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_river_hog).
1.9.7.1.5.1.2. Pro: The plants evolved before the apes and thus are quite capable of reproducing and spreading without them.
1.9.7.1.5.2. Pro: Gorillas appear to be potentially unique in spreading certain seeds in [open canopy environments](http://popups.ulg.ac.be/1780-4507/index.php?id=10293).
1.9.7.1.5.3. Con: Because of limited data, conclusions on the role of gorillas are of limited validity as, for example, this [study](http://popups.ulg.ac.be/1780-4507/index.php?id=10293) cautions.
1.9.7.1.5.4. Pro: The digested food, as it passes through their systems, helps seeds to [germinate](http://popups.ulg.ac.be/1780-4507/index.php?id=10293).
1.9.7.1.5.4.1. Pro: Investigations of the [fecal components](http://www.berggorilla.org/en/gorillas/general/ecology/articles-ecology/seed-dispersal-by-western-lowland-gorillas-from-fruits-to-seedlings/) of gorillas found many germinated seeds.
1.9.7.2. Con: The effects of habitat preservation for gorillas in Congo or Rwanda on starving children around the world is likely to be of limited importance because starving children elsewhere are too far away from these national parks.
1.9.7.3. Con: -> See 1.9.2.2.
1.9.7.4. Con: -> See 1.9.4.2.
1.9.7.5. Pro: Fighting against habitat destruction helps to prevent climate change which is an important cause of drought and starvation.
1.9.7.5.1. Pro: Gorilla protection safeguards their habitat. These habitats are often big forests.
1.9.7.5.2. Pro: The forests that gorillas live in could be a source of food for the local children. That way donating to saving gorillas indirectly helps children eat too.
1.9.7.5.3. Con: [Poverty](http://www.globalissues.org/article/425/poverty-and-the-environment) creates environmental problems. Thus, stopping starvation helps to reduce these problems.
1.9.7.5.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.7.1.1.3.
1.10. Con: A human life is worth more than the life of an animal. Thus it would be immoral to donate money to support gorillas whilst children are starving.
1.10.1. Pro: Generally speaking, in all societies, humans treat a human's life as being more important than an animal's life.
1.10.1.1. Pro: Humans enjoy basic rights and liberties on different levels, from [UN Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) to national constitutions. Animals do not have these kinds of rights and protections.
1.10.1.1.1. Con: Legal trends indicate that animals have rights.
1.10.1.1.1.1. Pro: In 2008, a committee of Spain's national legislature became the first to vote for a resolution [to extend limited rights](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/weekinreview/13mcneil.html?_r=2&ref=science&oref=slogin) to nonhuman primates.
1.10.1.1.1.2. Pro: Acknowledgement of [animals as ‘sentient’](http://www.animal-law.biz/node/1269) was introduced to New Zealand’s Animal Welfare Act 1999 in August 2015.
1.10.1.2. Con: Radical Hindu groups in India have been criticized for assigning more value to cows than to [women](http://www.southasia.com.au/2015/03/11/india-holy-cow-matters-women/) and [untouchables](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/india-cow-protection-violence-by-shashi-tharoor-2016-08).
1.10.1.2.1. Con: This refers to cows alone and is not the case for other animals in Hindu society.
1.10.1.2.2. Con: It is normal that subjects or objects that are considered to be sacred by a specific religion are treated as more important than the humans of that religion.
1.10.1.3. Pro: Only in war situations is a human life considered as being expendable for a cause. Otherwise the utmost is done to protect a human member of society.
1.10.1.3.1. Pro: Police and firemen are present in most societies to protect human lives.
1.10.1.3.2. Pro: The money invested into public health is higher than to animal welfare. This indicates the value assigned to human life.
1.10.1.4. Pro: Firemen first save humans and then, if still possible without endangering the firemen's lives, will they go and save animals.
1.10.1.5. Pro: Humans accept most livestock being treated in an abominable fashion, before being slaughtered.
1.10.1.5.1. Con: There are more and more people who buy organic products or do not consume animal products at all because of the livestock industry.
1.10.1.5.2. Con: Some animal activists take action and infiltrate [animal farms](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2512203/Animal-rights-activists-film-horrific-abuse-pigs-Tyson-farm.html).
1.10.1.5.2.1. Con: Those actions sometimes lead to [mass killings](http://www.agweb.com/article/animal-activists-are-resorting-to-break-ins--naa-anna-lisa-laca/) of animals when biosecurity barriers are breached.
1.10.1.6. Pro: A society where the life of an animal were worth as much as the life of a human would be doomed to fail.
1.10.1.6.1. Pro: It is impossible to treat animals like humans or give them all human rights. One would have to let carnivores starve to death.
1.10.1.6.2. Pro: Ownership of animals would become illegal, as that ownership nearly always entails restricting an animal's freedom.
1.10.1.6.3. Pro: The existence of some animals is bad for human lives. A society where we would not be able to kill those animals would have tremendous disadvantages for humans.
1.10.1.6.3.1. Pro: Many would have to share their homes with cockroaches as deliberately killing them would be considered murder.
1.10.1.6.3.2. Pro: [Animal-to-human diseases](http://www.livescience.com/21426-global-zoonoses-diseases-hotspots.html) kill around 2.2 million per year. Not being able to eradicate the source or the transmitter is threatening for humanity.
1.10.1.6.3.3. Pro: Humans with life threatening parasitic worms could not be cured as this would constitute murdering the worm.
1.10.1.6.4. Pro: Many activities that are essential or beneficial to humankind involve the killing of animals and could not be performed anymore.
1.10.1.6.4.1. Pro: Farming inevitably murders animals too, so that would have to be forbidden.
1.10.1.6.4.1.1. Pro: Mice, rats, worms, moles that all live in the ground inevitably are killed by large farming machines being run over them, upheaving the ground in order to sow the seeds for the next season.
1.10.1.6.4.2. Pro: Hydroelectric and wind energy power plants would be forbidden as they kill fish, birds and bats respectively.
1.10.1.6.4.3. Pro: Killing an animal unintentionally, like driving on a highway and being hit by a low-flying bird, would result in man\(life\)slaughter charges.
1.10.1.6.4.3.1. Pro: [Roadkill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadkill) is a frequently happening incident.
1.10.1.6.4.3.1.1. Pro: An [UK based study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadkill) with 40.000 partaking drivers came to the conclusion that one insect is squashed for every 5 miles \(8.0 km\) driven.
1.10.1.6.4.3.1.2. Pro: Annually there are around 253.000 [animal-vehicle accidents](http://www.hcn.org/issues/291/15268) in the USA.
1.10.1.6.4.3.1.3. Pro: In [Tasmania](http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/offtrack/tasmania-roadkill-capital-of-the-world/7021816), the “roadkill capital of the world”, the endangered devil is declining due to disease, yet roadkill is an important complicating factor, as it kills many of the surviving  healthy animals.
1.10.1.6.4.3.2. Con: If the driver is following traffic rules \(proper speed, use of lights or any other traffic signs\) and a collision happens, the driver would probably be acquitted of any charges in the same way that a case involving a human, where a collision is an unfortunate, yet not punishable, action.
1.10.1.6.5. Pro: Activities that hurt animals would have to be prohibited, even those that are fairly widespread in human society.
1.10.1.6.5.1. Pro: Animal products such as milk or eggs would be forbidden, as producing them harms animals even though it does not necessarily kill them.
1.10.1.6.5.1.1. Con: When animals receive the same rights as humans they also have to fulfill the same duties and contribute to society. Therefore they can be forced to work, e.g. on the fields or to pollenize plants and crops.
1.10.1.6.5.2. Pro: Horse-riding would probably be made illegal, as the horses did not consent to it and are often harmed by accidents or years of riding.
1.10.1.7. Pro: Taking away the life of an animal carries less consequences than taking the life of a human.
1.10.1.7.1. Pro: Humans accept euthanizing sick animals, without them giving any confirmation or consent that they want this to happen. This is wholly unacceptable with regards to humans.
1.10.1.7.1.1. Pro: No country accepts euthanizing people who are suffering, without their explicit consent.
1.10.1.7.1.2. Pro: In the US alone pet owners euthanize [2.7 million](http://www.aspca.org/animal-homelessness/shelter-intake-and-surrender/pet-statistics) animals per year.
1.10.1.7.2. Pro: There are no criminal charges for extinguishing a species while there are charges for killing a person.
1.10.1.7.3. Pro: When forced to make a decision humans choose a child over a gorilla, such as in the [Cincinnati Zoo](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bron-taylor/the-value-of-a-gorilla_b_10214928.html). This indicates that humans are worth more to other humans when forced to choose.
1.10.1.8. Con: Most people who donate to wildlife organisations do not treat human lives as being more important than lives of animals.
1.10.1.8.1. Pro: Their decision to donate to animal rather than human welfare indicates that animals' lives are more important for them.
1.10.1.8.1.1. Con: The moral burden that humans are often the [reason](http://metro.co.uk/2014/12/22/why-do-animal-charities-get-so-many-donations-because-were-the-reason-animals-need-help-4996066/#ixzz4EwQSx6uD) those animals need help is felt by many as the motivation to donate for animal charities.
1.10.1.8.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.4.
1.10.1.8.2. Con: If this were true, these people would have to protest in front of butcheries, farms and slaughterhouses, as if these were dealing with human meat, in which case they would. Alas the opposite is true and they are treating animal lives as being inferior to human lives.
1.10.1.9. Con: Pets of developed world owners mostly have more secure lives than most humans around the world.
1.10.1.9.1. Con: The love for a pet is an individual factor when considering caring about animals vs humans. It is not a societal norm.
1.10.1.9.2. Con: Even pets of developed world owners are slaves to their owners.
1.10.1.9.3. Con: -> See 1.10.1.7.1.2.
1.10.1.10. Pro: In times of economic constraints, cost-cutting measures hit animals first before humans.
1.10.1.10.1. Pro: During the 2008 financial crisis, horses — a domesticated and widely appreciated species — were left to starve on fields or brought to [slaughterhouses](http://www.lashermanasderocinante.com/).
1.10.2. Pro: Human life has a higher value because humans need and depend on each other, socially and economically.
1.10.2.1. Pro: The dominating form of economic organization is division of labor. Everyone is a specialist and highly depends on other individuals' skills and products.
1.10.2.2. Con: Animals are also responsible for important social tasks, e.g. guide dogs or [therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal-assisted_therapy) animals. Humans depend on animals for these functions.
1.10.2.3. Pro: Appreciation and commendation, which is very important to humans' self-perception, can only be given by other humans.
1.10.2.4. Pro: In classical [Greek philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nature). humans were described as social or political animals, with an innate propensity to develop more complex communities the size of a city or town, with a division of labor and law-making. Humans need these communities to develop their [full potential](http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-pol/#SH7c).
1.10.2.4.1. Con: [Recluses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recluse) have been around for most of human history testifying through their existence that humans do not necessarily depend on others.
1.10.2.5. Pro: Humans, as members of the same species, can identify with each other, feel what it is like to be in the situation of the other individual and thus develop a stronger feeling of compassion and sympathy than with animals.
1.10.2.6. Con: This may make us appreciate other humans more than we do animals, but does not mean that animal lives do not have value - to themselves, to other animals, and to the world.
1.10.2.7. Pro: Humans have better skills and capabilities, thus their lives are worth more.
1.10.2.7.1. Pro: Humans are the kings of the animal kingdom, they have mastered and beaten all other animals, using weapons, traps and intellect and are thus worth more than all the other animals.
1.10.2.7.2. Pro: Humanity has created culture, art and science.
1.10.2.7.3. Con: It is not clear why skill in tasks that humans value should determine the worth of a life.
1.10.2.7.4. Con: This would be a justification for valuing humans' lives differently based on their skills. However this would go against the principle of equality.
1.10.2.7.4.1. Pro: For example, murder carries the same penalty regardless of the victim.
1.10.2.8. Pro: Humans are the kings of the animal kingdom. We have mastered and beaten all other animals, using our superior tools and intelligence and thus we are worth more than all the other animals.
1.10.3. Con: The US government pays $2,500 in compensation for taking the life of an Iraqi, while a zoo pays between $100,000 and $200,000 for a gorilla. This indicates that some animals are more [expensive](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/philip-slater/the-price-of-human-and-go_b_22426.html), and thus worth more, than some human lives.
1.10.3.1. Con: In an imperfect world, where people are killed and insurance claims and compensations are paid, we have to attach a value to human lives, but these measures are never complete or good and have nothing to do with the way that the law sees the value of a human life relative to a gorilla's.
1.10.3.1.1. Pro: These figures differ from region to region. If you had taken an American's life that would have dwarfed the gorilla's by at least a factor of ten.
1.10.3.2. Con: The US government is in no position to be the final arbiter on judging the value of human life.
1.10.3.3. Con: The US government has an interest in keeping the costs of Iraqi deaths low and the power to influence the amount of payment. Thus, the figures are biased.
1.10.4. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.6.
1.10.5. Pro: Religious teachings emphasize the higher value of human life.
1.10.5.1. Pro: Gods are mostly displayed in human like features.
1.10.5.2. Con: The religious concept of [reincarnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation) suggests that an animal could become a human in another life \(and vice versa\), so their relative worth is subjective.
1.10.6. Pro: Because of their biological characteristics a human is worth more than an animal.
1.10.6.1. Pro: Humans conquered the world, indicating their superior capabilities.
1.10.6.2. Con: The [human](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human) being - as part of the primate group - is considered an animal as well. Thus, human lives equal animal lives.
1.10.6.2.1. Con: -> See 1.10.2.8.
1.10.6.2.2. Con: Humans exhibit different characteristics than other animals and thereby can be considered unique.
1.10.6.2.2.1. Pro: Humans have an upright posture which frees their hands to make use of tools. This is a groundbreaking difference from other primates who are less skilled in using tools.
1.10.6.2.2.2. Pro: Only humans have developed complex and advanced languages.
1.10.6.2.2.2.1. Con: Non-human [animal communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_language) shows similarities to human language.
1.10.6.2.2.2.1.1. Con: Similar but not understandable by humans. We understand each other as humans, but if we can't understand apes, then there's no benefit to their existence.
1.10.6.2.2.3. Pro: Humans are the only species on planet earth that makes use of [clothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing).
1.10.6.2.2.4. Pro: The human trait that sets us apart the most from the animal kingdom is our extraordinary brain which might not be the biggest or densest but allows for the ability to reason.
1.10.6.2.2.4.1. Pro: Humans have the capacity of practical reasoning, which can be defined as "a procedure through which we determine what we have most reason to do in order to reach our goals" [\(Frankfurt, p. 176\)](https://tannerlectures.utah.edu/_documents/a-to-z/f/frankfurt_2005.pdf).
1.10.6.2.2.4.2. Con: Some animals are capable of abstract reasoning.
1.10.6.2.2.4.2.1. Pro: Crows understand [analogies](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/crows-understand-analogies/).
1.10.6.2.2.4.2.2. Pro: Baboons exhibit [abstract reasoning](http://www.cnrs.fr/Cnrspresse/n398/html/en398a09.htm).
1.10.6.2.2.4.2.3. Pro: African grey parrots have the [reasoning skills](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/african-grey-parrots-have-the-reasoning-skills-of-3-year-olds-15955221/?no-ist) of 3-year-old humans.
1.10.6.2.2.4.3. Con: Research has examined [animal cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_cognition) in mammals \(e.g. primates, elephants, dogs, cats, horses, livestock etc.\), birds \(including parrots and pigeons\), reptiles \(lizards and snakes\), fish and even invertebrates \(including spiders and insects\).
1.10.6.2.2.4.3.1. Pro: Chimpanzees [solve problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-xFlKfmLGY) via cooperation.
1.10.6.2.2.4.3.2. Pro: Pigeons are capable of making [logical decisions](http://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/2180/20130530/pigeons-capable-solving-complex-problems.htm) using problem-solving skills.
1.10.6.2.2.4.3.3. Pro: Elephants can [use insight](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2011/08/aha-elephants-can-use-insight-solve-problems) to solve problems.
1.10.6.2.2.4.3.4. Pro: [IQ tests](http://news.discovery.com/animals/iq-tests-suggest-pigs-are-smart-as-dogs-chimps-150611.htm) suggest that pigs are as smart as chimps.
1.10.6.2.2.4.3.4.1. Pro: Domestic pigs can quickly learn how mirrors work and will use their [understanding of reflected images](http://researchers present evidence that domestic pigs can quickly learn how mirrors work and will use their understanding of reflected images to scope out their surroundings and find their food.) to scope out their surroundings and find their food.
1.10.6.2.2.4.3.5. Pro: Chickens are intelligent animals, performing well in tests of [advanced cognition](http://www.farmsanctuary.org/learn/the-someone-project/chickens/#).
1.10.6.2.2.4.3.6. Pro: Cattle display [visual individual recognition](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0004441) based on categorization capacities.
1.10.6.2.2.4.3.7. Pro: Insects possess small brains, but they exhibit sophisticated behavioral performances. Various insects species have unsuspected [cognitive capabilities](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcs.1348/epdf?r3_referer=wol&tracking_action=preview_click&show_checkout=1&purchase_site_license=LICENSE_DENIED_NO_CUSTOMER).
1.10.6.2.2.4.3.8. Pro: Cephalopods are generally regarded as the most intelligent group among the invertebrates and have a variety of [cognitive abilities](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/life-sciences/animal-behaviour/cephalopod-cognition?format=HB).
1.10.6.2.2.4.3.9. Pro: New Caledonian [crows](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8631486.stm) use sticks to reach their food in wild nature. So the use of tools can also be found in animality.
1.10.6.2.2.5. Pro: Humans are making use of fire unlike any other animal on the planet.
1.10.6.2.2.6. Pro: According to [Charles Darwin](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/468925-blushing-is-the-most-peculiar-and-most-human-of-all), only humans can blush which reveals the depth of social thought and innovative mechanisms to keep society together.
1.10.6.3. Con: Humans and animals are both just biomass. The self-perception of humans does not make for a good objective measurement.
1.10.6.3.1. Con: Plants, bacteria and viruses are part of the biomass too, by that logic all of their "lives" should thus be of equal worth.
1.10.6.3.1.1. Con: [Plants](http://www.intogreen.nl/en/topics/how-to/inspiration/we-couldnt-live-without-plants) and [bacteria](http://www.livescience.com/32761-good-bacteria-boost-immune-system.html) are necessary for humans to live and therefore are of equal worth.
1.10.6.3.2. Con: Most humans don't perceive themselves as 'just biomass'.
1.10.6.3.2.1. Con: Human self-perception can be entirely wrong and is thus not reliable.
1.10.6.3.2.1.1. Pro: Humans have been known to hallucinate and experience other psychotic symptoms distorting their perception of reality.
1.10.6.3.3. Con: Just as in any other product, the sophistication of assembly is what makes a resource valuable. That it is higher in humans is evident by in their mastering of nature, not achieved by any other animal.
1.10.7. Con: Faced with a hypothetical situation in which they could save only their pet or a foreign tourist from being hit by a bus, [40%](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/canine-corner/201308/is-dogs-life-worth-more-persons) of the participants chose their pet. For some the life of a human is apparently worth less.
1.10.7.1. Con: Pet lovers care about their pets because they have a special relationship with them, not because of their pets' status of being animals and thus deserving this much love.
1.10.7.1.1. Pro: Most pet lovers eat animals.
1.10.7.1.1.1. Pro: There are significantly more people that have a pet \([~80 mn](http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/pet_overpopulation/facts/pet_ownership_statistics.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/)\) than there are vegetarians \([~16 mn](https://news.therawfoodworld.com/16-million-people-us-now-vegan-vegetarian/)\), thus most pet lovers eat animals.
1.10.7.2. Con: The experiment represents individual reactions of biased pet owners and not general societal rules. In case the participants would have been asked about a categorical imperative how society should handle this, their answers would have been different.
1.10.7.2.1. Pro: Humans [act irrationally](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-science-of-irrational/), that is well [documented](http://www.businessinsider.com/predictably-irrational-2012-6?IR=T), but that does not mean that we as a society should make our moral judgement in similar irrational and emotional fashion.
1.10.7.2.1.1. Pro: There are countless experiments that document humans' inability to make rational choices, especially in situations of urgency.
1.10.7.3. Con: However the percentage decreases drastically to [2%](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/canine-corner/201308/is-dogs-life-worth-more-persons) if the human in the hypothetical situation is a friend or family member.
1.10.8. Pro: Humans have a higher responsibility to take care of children than gorillas.
1.10.8.1. Pro: Children are the weakest members of humankind, therefore their support and protection must be the highest priority.
1.10.8.1.1. Pro: Especially children under a certain age are highly dependent on help and support, otherwise they would not survive.
1.10.8.1.1.1. Pro: Humans' childhood, thus the period of high vulnerability, is extremely long compared to other animals and even [primates](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/08/why-do-humans-grow-so-slowly-blame-brain).
1.10.8.1.2. Pro: Charity for other humans as a foundation of morality is found in many religions, including [Christianity](https://www.openbible.info/topics/protecting_the_helpless) and [Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakat).
1.10.8.1.2.1. Con: According to the Catholic Church's official [Catechism](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a7.htm) regarding animals "men owe them kindness" \(2416\).
1.10.8.1.2.2. Pro: According to the Catholic Church's official Catechism, it is unworthy to spend money on animals that should as a [priority](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a7.htm) go to the relief of human misery \(2418\).
1.10.8.1.2.3. Con: According to [Qur'an 6:38](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/animals_1.shtml) Allah loves all animals and therefore they must be treated with kindness and compassion.
1.10.8.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.3.1.
1.10.8.1.4. Con: On a global scale children are exposed to very dangerous work. This illustrates that they do not enjoy the highest priority of protection.
1.10.8.1.4.1. Pro: Children in the [Philippines](http://time.com/4055289/child-miners-philippines-gold/) risk their lives in underwater gold mines.
1.10.8.1.4.2. Pro: Not many people care much about child labor as illustrated by continued sales of shoe manufacturers, such as [NIKE](http://www1.american.edu/ted/nike.htm).
1.10.8.2. Pro: First you take care of your own, then of others. This extends to species. First you take care of your own species, then of other species.
1.10.8.3. Pro: Helping gorillas and ignoring children is against the [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule) \(Ethics of Reciprocity\), one of humanity's oldest moral rules.
1.10.8.3.1. Con: [PETA](http://prime.peta.org/2011/02/rule2) claims that the Golden Rule should be applicable to animals as well.
1.10.8.3.1.1. Con: Only humans are capable of making [moral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_agency) based decisions and thus moral rules only apply to them.
1.10.8.3.1.2. Con: This would imply that human and animal rights should be valued equally, which is not feasible.
1.10.8.3.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.6.
1.10.8.3.2. Pro: Versions of the Golden Rule can be found in a large amount of [religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule#Religious_context) all over the world. This underlines its importance for human culture and community as well as its universality.
1.10.8.4. Con: The fact that humans share DNA does not give rise to responsibility for each other's actions.
1.10.8.4.1. Con: Humans share societal structures, which spread the benefit one human accrues through their actions through humankind as a whole. This benefit creates responsibility.
1.10.8.4.2. Pro: One can only be responsible for that which one has control over.
1.10.8.4.3. Pro: Humans do not have responsibility for other humans per se because they were not consulted when the child was produced.
1.10.8.4.3.1. Pro: According to Max Weber's ["Ethics of responsibility"](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weber/#EthConRes) one only has to respond to what one can foresee.
1.10.8.4.3.2. Con: Neither were they consulted when animals were produced.
1.10.8.4.4. Con: [Memetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics) shows that even though we may not be responsible for each other's actions directly, we do behave in ways that would suggest we feel responsible for the actions of others within our species.
1.10.8.5. Con: Human activity \(poaching\) is directly responsible for the near extinction of gorillas. As a result, humankind has acquired a responsibility to save them from the threat of extinction.
1.10.8.5.1. Pro: The human race is responsible for mitigating the harms members of our species cause.
1.10.8.5.1.1. Pro: Humans are in a uniquely powerful position in the world, and are the only species with the ability to mitigate our own actions.
1.10.8.5.1.2. Pro: The existence of human society means that structures exist for humans to control each other. Our failure to use those to effectively stop poaching makes us responsible for ongoing poaching.
1.10.8.5.1.3. Con: -> See 1.10.8.4.
1.10.8.5.2. Con: Human societies have already passed laws to ban poaching, and take steps to enforce them. This is enough to discharge any responsibility.
1.10.8.5.3. Con: -> See 1.9.5.
1.10.8.6. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.2.1.
1.10.9. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.7.3.
1.10.10. Con: Every day children are starving all over the world but actions remain limited.
1.10.10.1. Con: The problems that lead to starvation are often so intricate, like climate change or war, that it is unclear how to help.
1.10.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.
1.10.11. Pro: Losing the entire gorilla species is a lesser evil than having a single human child starve to death.
1.10.11.1. Con: Gorillas are primates and close cousins to us, which is why we should prevent them from going extinct.
1.10.11.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.1.
1.10.11.1.2. Pro: Gorillas and humans [share](http://www.gorillas-world.com/gorillas-and-humans/) 95-99% of their DNA. This is a bigger share than with the majority of other animals.
1.10.11.1.3. Con: -> See 1.10.8.4.
1.10.11.1.4. Con: Starving children share more with donors than do gorillas and therefore should be considered first.
1.10.11.1.5. Pro: As close "relatives" humans and gorillas have more characteristics in common than humans have with the majority of the animal kingdom.
1.10.11.1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.10.11.1.4.
1.10.11.1.5.2. Pro: [Gorilla](http://www.gorillas-world.com/gorillas-and-humans/) mothers and their offspring engage in a close relationship just like humans.
1.10.11.1.5.3. Pro: [Gorilla](http://www.gorillas-world.com/gorillas-and-humans/) growth and development is slow, and they reach sexual maturity after their first decade of life. Humans have similar growth stages.
1.10.11.1.5.4. Pro: [Gorillas](http://www.gorillas-world.com/gorillas-and-humans/), just like humans, have unique fingerprints as well as opposable thumbs.
1.10.11.1.5.5. Pro: Both have a [long gestation period](http://www.gorillas-world.com/gorillas-and-humans/), eight and a half months for gorillas and nine months for humans.
1.10.11.2. Con: Any species going extinct is at least as bad as a single child starving to death, as it means that no representative of that species will ever again roam on Earth.
1.10.11.2.1. Con: We successfully cloned sheep decades ago. Given the rapid advancement of genetics and science in general, it is virtually guaranteed that we will be able to clone gorillas in the future if need be, even if the whole species were to go [extinct](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/13/130310-extinct-species-cloning-deextinction-genetics-science/) now.
1.10.11.2.1.1. Con: There is good evidence that gorillas and other apes have [culture](http://www.livescience.com/7064-case-closed-apes-culture.html). This means that cloning them cannot bring them back. In this respect, the extinction of gorillas is tantamount to genocide.
1.10.11.2.1.2. Con: Cloning does not solve the problems that led to the extinction of a species in the first place. It treats the symptoms of the problem, not the cause.
1.10.11.2.1.3. Con: Whether cloning can work on the scale necessary to save whole species is speculation. [As of now](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cloning-endangered-animals/), cloning does not work reliably, often relies on genetic hybrids and creates animals that usually do not survive long.
1.10.11.2.1.4. Pro: The world's largest cloning factory \(Boyalife Group\) is already working to improve the [cloning of primates](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3341271/The-world-s-largest-cloning-factory-one-day-clone-HUMANS-Scientist-claims-technology-ready-public-opinion-isn-t.html) in order to better test the animals for diseases.
1.10.11.2.1.5. Con: The long-term viability of a species [depends](http://www.infoplease.com/cig/biology/natural-selection.html) upon genetic variation and natural selection.
1.10.11.2.2. Con: For this to be true, our legal systems would need to recognise the existence of a particular species as taking precedence over human life. This is not the case.
1.10.11.2.3. Pro: Although the death of an individual human is inevitable, the extinction of an entire species is not and is thus far worse.
1.10.11.2.4. Con: Humans want some species to go extinct and work actively for it, such as in the case of [mosquitoes](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35408835).
1.10.11.2.4.1. Con: Not all scientists agree on eradicating mosquitoes, as it can bring a lot of ‘[undesirable](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35408835) side effects’, even unpredictable ones. Mosquitos are part of the food chain and pollinators: even if their functions were to be substituted by another insect, it could as bad or worse as mosquitoes.
1.10.11.2.4.1.1. Pro: Another problem, yet [unexplained](http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/center/articles/2009/science-daily-12-06-2009.html) by scientists, is that [deforestation](http://www.chgeharvard.org/topic/biodiversity-and-infectious-diseases) and the decimation of the mosquito population has made the surviving ones even better at transmitting diseases like malaria.
1.10.11.2.5. Con: That a single species will never again roam on Earth is not bad in itself but natural when considering animal evolution.
1.10.11.2.6. Con: -> See 1.10.1.7.2.
1.10.11.2.7. Con: -> See 1.4.5.1.
1.10.11.2.8. Pro: The extinction of particular species may have disastrous [effects](http://sciencing.com/extinctions-other-creatures-affect-humans-directly-20692.html) on humans.
1.10.11.2.8.1. Pro: The loss of biodiversity can increase [infectious](http://www.chgeharvard.org/topic/biodiversity-and-infectious-diseases) diseases among [humans](http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/center/articles/2009/science-daily-12-06-2009.html). Pathogens get ‘diluted’ in different species, some being more able to host them than others. When more species disappear, those pathogens need to find new hosts, thus increasing the possibility of using humans as hosts.
1.10.11.2.8.1.1. Pro: A lot of pathogens travel from primates to humans and vice versa. Therefore, if some primates disappear, those pathogens may choose [humans](https://parasiteecology.wordpress.com/2013/03/18/the-dilution-effect-in-primate-disease/) as hosts. [\(Nunn, Gillespie, p. 164\)](http://people.nunn-lab.org/charlie/PDFs/123-Nunn-Gillespie-2016.pdf)
1.10.11.2.8.1.2. Con: The studies of pathogens in primates and humans are still not definitive, yet in some cases, pathogens hosted by primates have [affected](https://parasiteecology.wordpress.com/2013/03/18/the-dilution-effect-in-primate-disease/) humans more \(causing an ‘amplification’ effect, instead of a ‘dilution’ one\).
1.10.11.2.8.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.5.1.
1.10.11.2.8.2. Con: -> See 1.9.4.
1.10.11.2.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.1.4.2.
1.10.11.2.8.4. Pro: Plants and animals \(humans included\) are connected in our planet, they depend on each other, thus when one species is missing, that can lead to unpredictable [problems](https://www.thoughtco.com/why-it-matters-when-species-go-extinct-1182006) that are not easy to solve.
1.10.11.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.1.
1.10.11.4. Con: It is easy for humans to sustain the human population, but it is difficult to sustain the gorilla population. This makes the preservation of gorillas more valuable.
1.10.11.4.1. Con: -> See 1.10.11.2.1.
1.10.11.4.2. Pro: The value of an individual decreases in relation to the growing size of the population.
1.10.11.4.3. Con: It is common to extract the [semen](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3617620/There-future-Harambe-Cincinnati-zoo-reveal-sperm-removed-gorilla-shot-dead-father.html) of gorillas in captivity to preserve their genes. This makes reproduction easier.
1.10.11.5. Pro: Forced to make a choice, most humans would rather pull the switch to kill all remaining gorillas, rather than pulling the switch to kill a human child.
1.10.11.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.
1.10.11.5.2. Pro: If one were to kill all remaining gorillas, one would at worst be charged with illegal hunting and some violations regarding nature parks. In the case of killing a human one would be charged with murder.
1.10.11.5.3. Con: -> See 1.10.11.2.8.
1.10.12. Con: Life is not measurable.
1.10.13. Pro: Research has shown that humans are conscious beings while the consciousness in apes is still being [studied](https://carleton.ca/ics/wp-content/uploads/2002-10.pdf).
1.10.14. Pro: Humans have high mental abilities, they are not equally talented, and if you save these children, one or two might turn out to be scientists and become vets, help gorillas, but gorillas cannot help themselves in case of a disease, hence it's more logical to focus on human survival first in order to promote animal survival.
1.10.15. Con: The value of a human life is highly debatable, especially considering these cultures are responsible for their own starvation, contribute nothing, violate the "human rights" of their fellow man in their own societies, and over-hunt the gorilla in the first place.
1.10.16. Con: Rather absolutist of an assertion from a society that constantly asserts moral relativism. Since moral absolutism has not been established, this claim is baseless and dubious at best.
1.11. Con: Governments can earn money with their gorilla populations. This already provides them with a financial incentive to protect gorillas. The same reasoning is not applicable to starving children.
1.11.1. Pro: The International Gorilla Conservation Programme [recognizes](http://www.igcp.org/wp-content/themes/igcp/docs/pdf/MoyiniUganda.pdf) the economic benefits of Gorilla tourism for the government and local communities in Uganda.
1.11.2. Con: Equally, governments have a financial interest in eradicating poverty and ensuring that its people live successful lives that turn them into taxpayers and contributing citizens.
1.11.2.1. Con: Every additional child can add strain to existing services and resources.
1.11.2.2. Con: Initial investments to achieve a successful base of taxpayers are prohibitively high. This reduces the incentive governments have significantly.
1.11.2.2.1. Pro: Initial investments in areas such as healthcare, schooling or infrastructure require significant resources.
1.11.2.3. Con: It will take at least one generation for those in starvation to turn into high tax payers. Governments have no immediate interests in this long-term investment.
1.11.2.3.1.
