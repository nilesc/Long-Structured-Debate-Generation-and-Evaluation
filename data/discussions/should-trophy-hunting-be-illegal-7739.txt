Discussion Title: Should Trophy Hunting Be Illegal?

1. Trophy hunting should be illegal.
1.1. Pro: Trophy hunting encourages raising animals in captivity for the sole purpose of killing them, essentially enslaving them.
1.1.1. Con: This is no different than animals raised and bred for food production.
1.1.1.1. Con: Trophy hunters are not hunting out of necessity for food.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Furthermore, [unlike cattle](https://www.thoughtco.com/is-hunting-ever-defensible-127868), the hunted animal lived a free and wild life before being killed and had a chance to escape.
1.1.2. Pro: In South Africa, up to [70% of lions](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/07/150722-lions-canned-hunting-lion-bone-trade-south-africa-blood-lions-ian-michler/) are in held in captivity on breeding farms for canned hunting, for those who desire a more successful chance at shooting and killing one.
1.1.2.1. Pro: In [South Africa](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/10/trophy-hunting-killing-saving-animals/), which has some 2,000 wild lions, canned lion hunting has grown into a more than $100 million industry, with in excess of 200 facilities raising about 6,000 of the big cats for easy killing.
1.1.3. Con: This is comparable to animals being bred in zoos, and causes no direct harm to wild animals.
1.1.3.1. Con: Unlike a zoo trophy hunting lacks the same incentive to display animals in their natural environment. Many animals are used as [tourist traps](https://www.conservationconversation.co.uk/trophy-hunting) and petted before being killed. This is cruel and unethical.
1.1.3.2. Con: Unlike a zoo, breeding animals for trophy hunting leads to their death.
1.1.3.3. Con: [Animal rights activists](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2010/mar/08/wild-animals-captivity-seaworld-orca) have long argued that keeping animals in captivity also violates animal rights and assault their dignity. So even if this situation is comparable to zoos, that may not necessarily be a good thing.
1.1.3.4. Pro: Humans use animals for their own ends in a vast array of ways. It is hypocritical to specifically target trophy hunting because some find the practice distasteful.
1.1.3.4.1. Pro: There exist many circumstances in which animals are killed indirectly for pleasure, such as the production of leather or gourmet foods.
1.1.3.4.1.1. Con: Trophy hunting is different as it is [morally wrong](https://theconversation.com/is-hunting-moral-a-philosopher-unpacks-the-question-68645) for a human to enjoy the killing of another animal, in the above cases killing is a means to an end. For trophy hunting killing is the end.
1.1.3.4.1.2. Pro: [Foie gras \(fatty liver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foie_gras)\), for example is a French delicacy food item created by force-feeding a duck or goose.
1.1.3.4.1.2.1. Con: Just because something bad is allowed to occur in the status quo gives no reason to allow other harmful things to happen.
1.1.3.4.1.3. Con: Trophies as decoration, art, or awards are unnecessary to basic human needs, whereas killing for food and materials is seen as a way to fulfill basic human needs.
1.1.3.4.1.3.1. Con: While such activities are a means to fulfill a need. They are not necessary to fulfill such needs - i.e. vegans are able to fulfill those same needs without killing animals.
1.1.3.4.2. Pro: Many practices in modern life cause untold damage to animals, as demonstrated by the Global Footprint Network ecological [calculator](http://www.footprintcalculator.org/). Just because trophy hunting is more apparent doesn't make it worse.
1.1.3.4.3. Pro: In plenty of countries, such as New Zealand, the decision to own a domestic cat does a [phenomenal amount](http://morganfoundation.org.nz/cats/damage/) of harm to protected species.
1.1.3.4.4. Pro: Keeping pets, which we treat essentially as property, is an example of widespread [subjugation of animals](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/aug/01/should-we-stop-keeping-pets-why-more-and-more-ethicists-say-yes). The deprivation of their natural habitats and the control human exert over their lives is more unethical than hunting.
1.1.3.4.4.1. Con: It is possible to [responsibly](https://www.peta.org/about-peta/why-peta/pets/) own a pet, while simultaneously pursuing a world with fewer domestic animals. The cruelty of hunting, for the animals involved, is unavoidable.
1.1.3.4.5. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.1.1.
1.1.3.4.6. Con: The harm to animals in other parts of modern life can, and should, be mitigated. The suffering of the animals involved in trophy hunts is unavoidable.
1.1.3.4.7. Pro: The way in which animals are mass slaughtered for human consumption is seen as inhumane and distasteful to many, but because there is a demand for it we continue to do it.
1.1.3.4.8. Pro: To justify banning trophy hunting, and not banning pet ownership, leather, or other luxuries that come at the expense of animals, it is a requirement to prove that it is worse. Without doing so the ban simply discriminates against a particular leisure activity.
1.1.3.4.8.1. Con: Rather than discrimination, banning trophy hunting could be the first step towards more animal friendly policy. Political progress can be made by targeting the "low hanging fruit" first.
1.1.3.4.8.2. Con: Trophy hunting is uniquely harmful because not only does it lead to the killing of animals for fun, it leads to the killing of animals that belong to endangered species unlike other aforementioned acts.
1.1.3.4.8.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.1.2.1.
1.1.4. Pro: According to [Ian Michler](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/10/trophy-hunting-killing-saving-animals/), animals are caged and bred sometimes under terrible conditions. The young are taken from their mothers and brought to petting zoos. When male lions grow into adulthood, many are shot and killed for “hunting” fees that are much lower than the cost for a wild lion on a standard 21-day hunt \($5,000 to $15,000, versus $50,000 and up\).
1.1.5. Con: Canned hunting prevents the extinction of endangered species.
1.1.5.1. Pro: Canned hunting involves breeding endangered animals in order for them to be hunted. As such, more endangered animals are bred.
1.1.5.1.1. Con: There is no benefit. These animals are being bred to be killed off.
1.1.5.2. Pro: There is an incentive to ensure that sufficient animals are bred to ensure a sustainable population so that the canned hunting operation may continue indefinitely.
1.1.6. Con: Canned hunting represents a very small proportion of hunting and raises very different issues from trophy hunting of free-ranging animals. It is condemned by existing [IUCN policy](https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/resrecfiles/WCC_2004_REC_93_EN.pdf).
1.1.6.1. Pro: If it is shown that "canned hunting" has harms that do not exist for trophy hunting \(i.e. the treatment of animals in captivity\) then it would be reasonable to ban "canned hunting" while still allowing trophy hunting.
1.1.6.1.1. Con: The glamour of trophy hunting is what drives the business of canned hunting. It is very difficult to eradicate "canned hunting" by law as it takes place in many different jurisdictions. In contrast an import ban on trophies is relatively easy to implement in the country of origin of trophy hunters. Thus banning trophy hunting is the only way to eradicate "canned hunting" as it undermines its cultural drivers.
1.1.7. Pro: It is immoral to encourage pleasure or pride on the basis of killing living beings.
1.2. Con: Trophy hunting helps with anti-poaching efforts.
1.2.1. Pro: Payments from trophy hunting [incentivise](http://www.conservationmagazine.org/2014/01/can-trophy-hunting-reconciled-conservation/) locals to give the animals land and protect them from poachers.
1.2.1.1. Con: In Tanzania the amount of money per capita raised by trophy hunting was approximately [50 cents](https://www.conservationconversation.co.uk/trophy-hunting). This is far too little money to encourage wildlife preservation.
1.2.2. Con: Trophy hunting is nothing more than poaching with restrictions. Both kill animals.
1.2.3. Con: In Namibia, despite trophy hunting, there were 60 black rhino [poached](https://www.conservationconversation.co.uk/trophy-hunting) in 2015.
1.2.4. Con: According to a report “[The Myth of Trophy Hunting](https://www.saveafricananimals.org/attachments/article/136/The_%20Myth_of_Trophy_Hunting_as_Conservation.pdf)” by Save African Animals, “Opening up even a limited legal trade creates a smokescreen for poachers which is almost impossible to police. Prior to 1986, when the whaling moratorium was introduced, legal quotas were widely used as cover for poaching, driving some species near to extinction. The same is happening with trophy hunting of endangered species.”
1.2.4.1. Pro: The bones of big cats can be used in traditional medicine. There is concern that the legal sale of the products of trophy hunting is [fuelling demand](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/10/trophy-hunting-killing-saving-animals/) for illegal poaching to supplement the supply.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: [Lion bones](https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/trade-in-african-lion-bones-for-asian-market-faces-scrutiny/) have recently become an expansion of illegal activity, using them for tonics in place of tiger bones due to the depletion of tigers from poaching.
1.2.5. Pro: Without viable ways to sustain themselves, locals resort to illegal activities and hunting practices, endangering wildlife even more. Revenue from trophy hunting can provide the funds and resources necessary for locals to live more comfortably.
1.2.5.1. Pro: Trophy hunting benefits local communities.
1.2.5.1.1. Con: The increasing value of lands fit for trophy hunting has led to greater seizures and displacements of the people living there by corrupt governments.
1.2.5.1.1.1. Pro: An increasing number of Maasai people in Tanzania's Serengeti region have repeatedly [been evicted](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/science/elephants-lions-africa-hunting.html) from their land by a luxury and safari company operating with a special "Presidential permit".
1.2.5.1.1.2. Con: While corrupt Governments may take advantage of valuable assets, such as land, this increase in value also represents a [boon to local communities](https://www.iucn.org/downloads/iucn_informingdecisionsontrophyhuntingv1.pdf), who may have few other opportunities.
1.2.5.1.1.3. Pro: In Zimbabwe, authorities [have](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/30/zimbabwe-mugabe-white-farmers) seized hunting preserves without compensation to those living there or reinvestment into conservation.
1.2.5.1.2. Pro: Trophy hunting creates much-needed jobs.
1.2.5.1.2.1. Con: A report conducted by the Economists at Large found that [trophy hunting](http://www.hsi.org/news/press_releases/2017/02/hunting-economic-impact-report-020117.html?referrer=http://www.africanindaba.com/2017/02/the-lions-share-on-the-economic-benefits-of-trophy-hunting-february-2017-volume-15-1/) in Botswana, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe brings in only 0.76 percent or less of overall tourism jobs.
1.2.5.1.2.1.1. Pro: This amounts to 7,500-15,500 jobs , a marginal amount in comparison to the [2.5 million jobs](http://www.hsi.org/news/press_releases/2017/02/hunting-economic-impact-report-020117.html?referrer=http://www.africanindaba.com/2017/02/the-lions-share-on-the-economic-benefits-of-trophy-hunting-february-2017-volume-15-1/) tourism generates.
1.2.5.1.2.2. Pro: Each hunting operation typically [results](http://www.conservationmagazine.org/2015/10/what-if-we-banned-trophy-hunting-in-africa/) in 8-10 jobs along with meat left behind for the communities.
1.2.5.1.2.3. Pro: In the Nyae Nyae conservancy \(Namibia\) the external companies that operate the trophy hunts are [required to hire](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/10/trophy-hunting-killing-saving-animals/) and train locals.
1.2.5.1.2.3.1. Con: It is not clear why this would or could apply to other regions and circumstances.
1.2.5.1.2.4. Pro: A research in 2014 investigated the economic impact of hunting in South Africa’s Limpopo, Northern Cape and Free State provinces and found that 17,806 \(Limpopo\), 9,072 \(Northern Cape\) and 4,558 \(Free State\) jobs may depend on hunting, in addition to those of people permanently employed on game farms. Consequently, the absence of hunting would have meant a reduction of 31,436 jobs in these provinces\([pg.14](https://africacheck.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Economic-impact-1.pdf)\).
1.2.5.1.3. Pro: Trophy hunting creates a positive influx of revenue and resources within the local communities.
1.2.5.1.3.1. Pro: In [some instances](http://www.conservationmagazine.org/2015/10/what-if-we-banned-trophy-hunting-in-africa/), locals are allowed to hunt the animals for subsistence. Doing so can mean feeding members of the community and using the money they do have on other necessities.
1.2.5.1.3.2. Con: Many of these communities never see the funds generated from trophy hunting.
1.2.5.1.3.3. Pro: Local communities often receive money as part of hunting agreements.
1.2.5.1.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.
1.2.5.1.3.3.2. Pro: Each adult member of the Nyae Nyae tribe was issued [$70](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/10/trophy-hunting-killing-saving-animals/) as revenue from trophy hunting was shared communally.
1.2.5.1.3.3.3. Pro: Because the animals are worth more alive than dead, locals will refrain from killing them.
1.2.5.1.3.3.3.1. Pro: Many of the exotic animals subject to trophy hunts in reality pose a substantial threat to local communities.
1.2.5.1.3.3.3.1.1. Pro: Lions eat livestock and have been known to[attack](https://thetylt.com/culture/should-trophy-hunting-be-banned) small children and adults.
1.2.5.1.3.3.3.1.2. Pro: A single elephant [can](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/10/trophy-hunting-killing-saving-animals/) trample or devour an entire farmer's crop overnight.
1.2.5.1.3.3.3.1.3. Pro: Giraffes represent [competition](https://thetylt.com/culture/should-trophy-hunting-be-banned) to Masai cattle-herders for water.
1.2.5.1.3.3.3.2. Pro: Too often people have seen an elephant destroy their annual crop, and some have known the pain of a lurking lion taking a child for food. To protect themselves against the enemy, villagers often shoot and poison these intruders, without an iota of sentimentality. However, if those animals are worth money to a local community, that community will work hard to conserve and [protect its assets](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/10/trophy-hunting-killing-saving-animals/).
1.2.5.1.3.3.3.2.1. Con: Trophy hunting actually reduces the worth of these animals. As long as an animal is alive it can be used to generate revenue through tourism. Once dead this potential [future earning](http://www.endangeredspecieshandbook.org/persecution_trophyecotourism.php) is lost for a relatively small one time payment.
1.2.5.1.3.3.3.2.2. Pro: [Conflict](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/11/24/opinions/trophy-hunting-decline-of-species-opinion-dickman/index.html) usually involves poisoning, shooting or spearing lions, either to retaliate for \(or try to prevent\) attacks on livestock or people.
1.2.5.1.3.3.3.2.3. Con: There are alternative ways to prevent animals interacting with humans.
1.2.5.1.3.3.3.2.3.1. Pro: The Giant's Club \(a pan-African conservation initiative\) has worked with the government of Gabon to build [an electric fence](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/how-a-twometrehigh-electric-fence-will-help-elephants-and-humans-to-live-in-harmony-a3332116.html) to keep animals from crops.
1.2.5.1.3.3.3.2.3.1.1. Con: The electric fence does not seem to be a far better solution. It hurts animals and may potentially kill them too, through no fault of their own.
1.2.5.1.3.3.3.2.4. Pro: In the [Campfire communities](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/science/elephants-lions-africa-hunting.html) of Zimbabwe, elephants have destroyed over 17,000 acres of crops from 2010 to 2015 and have killed 139 community members since 2010. Without trophy hunting, these animals would be treated as pests to the community and killed off.
1.2.5.1.3.4. Pro: Trophy hunting can improve the diet of a community through the relative abundance of [meat it provides](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/10/trophy-hunting-killing-saving-animals/).
1.2.5.1.3.4.1. Con: The killing of human beings can also improve the diet of a community by giving them meat. This is not an acceptable reason to kill human beings and therefore should not be an acceptable reason to kill animals.
1.2.5.1.3.4.2. Con: Only trophy hunting of large animals provides communities with lots of meat. Trophy hunting of smaller animals does not.
1.2.5.1.3.4.3. Con: The logical outcome of this claim is worrying because this would lead to the legalisation of the trophy hunting of species most at risk of becoming extinct.
1.2.5.1.3.5. Pro: Trophy hunting can generate income where little alternative exists and in areas which are not suitable for other sustainable uses, such as photo tourism. Trophy hunting is potentially viable in remote areas lacking infrastructure, attractive scenery, or high densities of viewable wildlife \([pg.10](http://www.africanwildlifeconservationfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Economic-and-conservation-significance.pdf)\).
1.2.5.1.3.6. Pro: Trophy hunting is generally more resilient to political instability than tourism as hunters continue to visit politically unstable countries. With the onset of land redistribution in Zimbabwe, for example, tourist occupancy fell by 75%, whereas trophy hunting revenues dropped by only 12.2% \([pg.10](http://www.africanwildlifeconservationfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Economic-and-conservation-significance.pdf)\).
1.2.5.1.3.7. Con: In Tanzania, where all hunting areas are government owned and leased to hunting companies, local companies [end up subleasing](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0162610&type=printable) to international operators. This leads to the money going overseas.
1.2.5.1.3.8. Con: On average for 11 main African big game hunting countries, the surface area occupied by big game parks is 14.9% of national territory, and the contribution of big game hunting to the GDP is 0.06%. This makes the economic productivity of these hectares very low \([pg.16](https://portals.iucn.org/library/efiles/documents/2009-074-En.pdf)\).
1.2.5.1.3.9. Pro: The [CAMPFIRE Program](https://huntforever.org/2015/09/21/hunting-is-conservation-the-campfire-program-in-zimbabwe/) was initiated in 1988 in Zimbabwe as a  means to ensure that local communities benefited from hunting safari concessions operating in their area.
1.2.5.1.3.9.1. Con: The benefits of the CAMPFIRE program are [not shared equally](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13892249785300311), with much lost to corruption.
1.2.5.1.3.9.2. Pro: Between 1989 and 2004, the program raised about US$30 million, which was channeled back into the communities. More recently, [CAMPFIRE’s](https://huntforever.org/2015/09/21/hunting-is-conservation-the-campfire-program-in-zimbabwe/) impact on national income is at least US$10 million annually. If the multiplier on tourism activities is included, CAMPFIRE is worth US$20-25 million to Zimbabwe’s economic income each year.
1.2.5.1.3.9.3. Pro: [CAMPFIRE](https://huntforever.org/2015/09/21/hunting-is-conservation-the-campfire-program-in-zimbabwe/) was designed to give control of wildlife management to rural communities, so that they would invest in wildlife and habitat conservation and in turn, receive dividends. Profits from the project are used for communal benefit or distributed to individual households at the discretion of the community.
1.2.5.1.3.10. Con: A [study](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/5-reasons-trophy-hunting-is-not-conservation/) on the economic benefit behind lion hunting in Africa concluded, “The suggestion that trophy hunting plays a significant role in African economic development is misguided…Revenues constitute only a fraction of a percent of GDP and almost none of that ever reaches rural communities.”
1.2.5.1.4. Con: If communities are dependent on trophy hunting for their economy, it creates a reliance on the Western world which prevents the community from developing.
1.2.5.1.4.1. Pro: The 2014 US ban on ivory trade [negatively impacted](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/11/151715-conservation-trophy-hunting-elephants-tusks-poaching-zimbabwe-namibia/) the Chiredzi Rural District of Zimbabwe, which depended in part on trophy hunting of elephants as a source of income.
1.2.5.1.4.2. Pro: [108 out of 189](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/science/elephants-lions-africa-hunting.html) American hunters canceled their elephant hunting trip in Zimbabwe after the 2014 US ivory ban went into effect.
1.2.5.1.4.3. Con: Development can proceed far faster with income from citizens of rich countries.
1.2.5.1.4.3.1. Pro: Trophy hunting, which draws in visitors to areas and countries they might not otherwise travel to, provides an opportunity for acquiring generalisable skills, such as working in the hospitality or tourism industry.
1.2.5.1.4.3.1.1. Con: Communities can learn these skill sets through various means. Learning them is not exclusive to trophy hunting being allowed.
1.2.5.1.4.3.1.2. Pro: [Photo-tourism](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/11/24/opinions/trophy-hunting-decline-of-species-opinion-dickman/index.html) is often touted as a replacement, but in many remote, less attractive areas, it would not generate sufficient revenue to maintain land as a wildlife area.
1.2.5.1.4.3.1.3. Con: Ecotourism can provide the same opportunity for locals to acquire skills in hospitality and tourism.
1.2.5.1.4.3.1.4. Con: The number of trophy hunters is very small, meaning they have little impact on other industries. In South Africa it is [estimated](https://africacheck.org/factsheets/factsheet-how-much-does-hunting-contribute-to-african-economies/) that there may be just ~18,500 trophy hunters and ~33.8 million visitors annually.
1.2.5.1.4.3.2. Pro: The money local communities gain from trophy hunting can be put into other local projects, which in the long run, would allow a diversification from trophy hunting.
1.2.5.1.4.3.2.1. Pro: In the Masoka ward in Zimbabwe the [CAMPFIRE programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communal_Areas_Management_Programme_for_Indigenous_Resources)  \(indigenous owned and managed hunting\) was used to fund the construction of a school, a clinic, a mill, and water sources.
1.2.5.1.4.3.3. Pro: The infrastructure trophy hunting creates, i.e. the parks, the transportation, even the wildlife, can be transferred easily to other forms of tourism.
1.2.5.1.4.4. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.4.3.3.
1.2.5.1.5. Pro: Trophy hunting creates an incentive for local communities to keep the animals alive.
1.2.5.1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.3.3.
1.2.5.1.5.2. Pro: Unlike tourism trophy hunting creates [incentives](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cobi.12643/full) to keep areas with low densities or hard to see wildlife protected.
1.2.5.1.5.3. Pro: Many of these animals live on private land, including [twenty five percent of all white rhinos](http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/endangered_species/rhinoceros/african_rhinos/white_rhinoceros/). Keeping the animals in good favor of land owners is thus paramount.
1.2.5.1.5.4. Con: The local communities get low gains from trophy hunting. They, therefore, tend to not respect the hunting areas and prefer poaching \([pg.84](https://portals.iucn.org/library/efiles/documents/2009-074-En.pdf)\).
1.2.5.1.5.4.1. Pro: Very little of the money gained from trophy hunting reaches communities \([Campbell 3](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ifaw-pantheon/sites/default/files/legacy/Ecolarge-2013-200m-question.pdf)\).
1.2.5.1.5.4.1.1. Pro: An [extensive study](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/christopher-clark/beneath-the-surface-of-th_b_8213258.html) concludes that in nine African countries that allow trophy hunting, the “sport” accounted for just 1.8% of total tourism revenue, while, more crucially, only 3% of the money actually reached the rural communities where hunting occurs.
1.2.5.1.5.4.1.2. Pro: A 2009 report from the[IUCN](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/11/elephant-trophy-hunting-psychology-emotions/546293/) revealed that sport hunting in West Africa does not provide significant benefits to the surrounding communities.
1.2.5.1.5.4.1.3. Con: A [study](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cobi.12643/full) in Namibia found that the money generated from trophy hunting was distributed in communities differently to tourism, but supported essential improvements.
1.2.5.1.5.4.1.3.1. Pro: A [study](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cobi.12643/full) found that jobs from tourism were not distributed evenly within a community, with a few skilled people reaping the benefits. In contrast non-financial benefits, such as meat, from trophy hunting were.
1.2.5.1.5.4.1.3.2. Pro: Trophy hunting generated considerably higher amounts of money for [conservation management](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cobi.12643/full) than tourism, which was essential.
1.2.5.1.5.4.1.4. Con: This claim needs to be viewed in comparison to equivalent sources of revenue, such as tourism. In contrast to tourism, which is often run from overseas, most hunting businesses are run by people who live within the country itself. This means [far less](http://www.africanwildlifeconservationfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Economic-and-conservation-significance.pdf) of the money tends to leave the country.
1.2.5.1.5.4.1.5. Pro: Local communities in Zambia, Tanzania, Namibia, Central African Republic, Burkina Faso and Benin receive only 20 to 88 CFA F \(0.04 to 0.18 $US\) per hectare of hunting area \([pg.18](https://portals.iucn.org/library/efiles/documents/2009-074-En.pdf)\).
1.2.5.1.5.4.2. Pro: The informal bush meat sector is much more profitable and poachers are therefore the primary beneficiaries of the wildlife sector \([pg.84](https://portals.iucn.org/library/efiles/documents/2009-074-En.pdf)\).
1.2.5.1.5.4.2.1. Pro: In [Ghana](https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Bush-meat-generates-300-million-for-Ghana-annually-171426), the bush meat trade makes an annual turnover of $US 300 million.
1.2.5.1.5.4.3. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.3.9.2.
1.2.5.1.5.4.4. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.4.3.2.1.
1.2.5.1.5.4.5. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.5.4.1.3.2.
1.2.5.1.6. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.5.4.1.
1.2.6. Pro: Banning hunting increases poaching.
1.2.6.1. Con: -> See 1.2.4.
1.2.6.2. Pro: Illegal poaching increased in [Kenya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_hunting_in_Kenya) when it banned trophy hunting in 1977. After losing more than half their elephant population, Kenya is considering reinstating it to decrease poaching efforts.
1.2.7. Pro: Hunting revenues can be [channeled](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2017/11/27/on-the-vices-and-virtues-of-trophy-hunting/) to underpaid and under-equipped rangers to improve their capacity and reduce susceptibility to corruption.
1.2.8. Con: South Africa, Namibia, and Tanzania allow trophy hunting and have significant problems with poaching. Botswana, in contrast, bans trophy hunting and has [almost no poaching](http://www.zambiatourism.com/lifting-the-big-cat-hunting-ban-some-thoughts-and-a-call).
1.2.8.1. Con: Botswana has a "shoot to kill poachers on sight" policy - which many consider a barbaric deterrent.  Plus, its anti-poaching programs are now running out of money due to government austerity programs. Trophy hunting would help herd management and raise revenue for Botswana's anti-poaching efforts - without a "shoot to kill" policy.  You may read all about this policy by Googling "Botswana shoot to kill poachers" and the funding shortfall here:  [tinyurl.com](https://tinyurl.com/ya9gcece)
1.2.9. Con: There is evidence, from a [study on US wolves](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsb/283/1830/20152939.full.pdf), that legalised killing encourages poaching and illegal killing. It was hypothesised that this may be due to the legalisation of killing signaling that the animal has less worth, therefore poaching would be less of a moral wrong.
1.2.9.1. Con: The incentives and environment in the US are likely very different from those where the majority of trophy hunting occurs \(i.e. unlike elephants, US wolves don't threaten crops\). Thus the motivations for illegal killing are different, therefore this analysis may not apply.
1.2.9.1.1. Con: US wolves pose a significant [threat](http://www.beefmagazine.com/pasture-range/wolves-economic-bite-cattle-goes-way-beyond-predation) to cattle in many parts of the country.
1.2.9.1.1.1. Con: There are many ways to combat this "threat" that do not involve trophy hunting or needlessly killing animals.
1.2.10. Pro: The presence of trophy hunting operators on the ground directly reduces illegal hunting.
1.2.10.1. Pro: In Save Valley Conservancy in [Zimbabwe](http://dailycaller.com/2012/08/27/stealing-the-save-valley-conservancy-zimbabwe%E2%80%99s-last-hope-in-peril/), revenue from trophy hunting enables hunting operators to employ anti-poaching game scouts.
1.2.10.2. Pro: In [Zambia](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=OlehgZ-khncC&pg=PA86&lpg=PA86&dq=Administrative+Design+for+Game+Management+Areas+anti-poaching&source=bl&ots=zicjPv08JX&sig=EV-np4YltesxJrBh_Vt-J_AKAa4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiQyvrMqN_YAhUFF5QKHTckBToQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&q=Administrative%20Design%20for%20Game%20Management%20Areas%20anti-poaching&f=false), one of the achievements of ADMADE has been the use of hunting revenues to employ village scouts for anti-poaching in Game Management Areas.
1.2.10.3. Con: Shifting illegal poaching behaviours to trophy hunting behaviours still does not reduce the likelihood of animals suffering, and doesn't necessarily reduce the amount of animals killed.
1.2.11. Pro: The most [prominent](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/extinction-countdown/african-lion-populations-drop-42-percent-in-past-21-years/) threats to these animals are loss of habitat and poaching.
1.2.11.1. Con: Trophy hunting may be the easiest of these threats to eliminate, given the legal nature in which it is initiated.
1.3. Con: People gain considerable enjoyment from trophy hunting.
1.3.1. Pro: Some parts of the US trophy hunting is embedded in the national psyche, with people continuing the traditions of those such as [Theodor Roosevelt](http://www.theodoreroosevelt.org/site/c.elKSIdOWIiJ8H/b.8344379/k.2B69/The_Hunter.htm), of "fair chase."
1.3.1.1. Pro: "Fair chase" is rooted in a deep seated [respect](https://pope-young.org/fairchase/) for wildlife that extends beyond the hunt itself.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: It is argued that in modern society the motivations and actions of many hunters [have morphed](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/10/trophy-hunting-killing-saving-animals/). Like everyone else they are shaped by the forces of social media, creating a "kill-and-tell generation." Photos are taken in ways that undermine the dignity of the animal in order to look impressive. This is far from the ideals of "fair chase."
1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Evolutionary anthropologists found that trophy hunting allows certain groups of men to ['cost-signal'](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/animal-emotions/201703/why-men-trophy-hunt-showing-and-the-psychology-shame) to other men. This shows other men that they are of a certain financial status, and able to exhibit certain behaviors not available to men of lower financial status, a hunter-gatherer behavior that is important in warding off competition and attracting a mate.
1.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Killing animals to find suitable partners seems rather bizarre. Surely, there must be other ways that do not involve killing animals and causing substantial harm to entire species to achieve this end.
1.3.1.1.1.2. Con: For centuries animals have been skinned and stuffed by trophy hunters. If that is allowed under "fair chase", then taking pictures of a dead animal should not really be a problem.
1.3.1.1.1.2.1. Con: If skinning animals and stuffing them for display disrespects them, then that too is against the principles of "fair chase" and should not be allowed just like taking pictures that harm the dignity of an animal should not.
1.3.1.1.1.3. Con: Even if this argument is true, it only proves why taking undignified pictures of animals is morally wrong or should not be allowed. However, it does not prove why trophy hunting should be illegal.
1.3.1.2. Pro: Aldo Leopold, the "father of conservation," described in A Sand Country Almanac, [said](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/zorn/ct-hunting-debate-20150730-story.html) "The instinct that finds delight in the sight and pursuit of game is bred into the very fiber of the race."
1.3.1.3. Con: There are many traditions that are now considered unacceptable, despite the amount of enjoyment they brought to people. Trophy hunting should be such a tradition.
1.3.1.4. Con: It cannot be considered a 'fair chase' if it is only fair for the hunter while putting the animal at a considerable disadvantage.
1.3.1.4.1. Pro: There is no such thing as "fair chase" when hunters shoot game with rifles, shotguns, and bows and arrows—weapons that no animal has any chance of outrunning, let alone fighting.
1.3.2. Pro: Taxidermy of the trophies is an art, which many people enjoy.
1.3.2.1. Con: Taxidermists can practice their art in an [ethical way](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/02/160217-video-taxidermy-art-animals-death-ethics/) that doesn't involve killing animals.
1.3.2.2. Pro: There are some taxidermists that see [beauty in death](http://www.cnn.com/style/article/when-taxidermy-becomes-art/index.html), viewing it as a piece of art.
1.3.2.2.1. Con: Death occurs naturally. If some people want to see beauty in death, they can surely wait. There is no need to cause death to see death.
1.3.2.2.2. Con: There are some people who see beauty in raping, torturing or killing other people. Some of them may view it as a piece of art too. Their opinion about the subject has no impact on the morality of said subject.
1.3.2.3. Con: A trophy can be a good picture of an animal instead of its carcass.
1.3.3. Con: Because of the [enormous expense](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/01/25/exotic-game-hunts-costs/1864667/) involved trophy hunting is only available to a privileged minority, thus while they may enjoy it, this is outweighed by the costs to the community and the wildlife.
1.3.3.1. Con: The top of many activities, such as professional sport, is unreachable for the vast majority of people. However knowledge that it exists gives people the joy of aspiration, thus all hunters can benefit from trophy hunting, in the same way all football players can benefit from the professional leagues.
1.3.3.1.1. Con: Even though the vast majority of people can not attain turn into top level professionals in these sports, professional leagues give them hope via stories of people succeeding because of their talent and hard work. This is not true for trophy hunting which requires money and is not based on talent.
1.3.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.4.3.1.4.
1.3.3.3. Con: A lot of activities that contribute to human enjoyment are only available to a privileged few; that is no reason to make them illegal or to prescribe them as immoral.
1.3.4. Con: The feeling of enjoyment is not needed to survive.
1.3.4.1. Pro: [Maslow's pyramid of needs](https://www.cengage.com/resource_uploads/downloads/0495570540_162121.pdf) describes the growth of a human as accomplishing different steps to reach a higher level. To obtain the lowest levels of the pyramid, physiological and safety needs, the feeling of enjoyment is not required. It can be concluded that a person can develop himself beyond the basic needs, and in this way survive, without experiencing the feeling of enjoyment.
1.3.4.2. Con: The "[pursuit of happiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life,_Liberty_and_the_pursuit_of_Happiness)" \(or its equivalent\) is considered to be a right, or at least, to have significant moral weight, in numerous philosophical [frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_happiness#Early_Modern).
1.3.4.2.1. Con: The pursuit of happiness of an individual that involves destruction of happiness of another being is highly objectable.
1.3.4.3. Con: [Some studies](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2011/10/happiness-associated-longer-life) show an association between happiness and longer life.
1.3.4.3.1. Con: To lengthen one's life by a minuscule amount by taking someone else's life is selfish.
1.3.4.3.2. Con: There are many things that human beings can do to experience happiness. While hunting might be one of them for some, if happiness \(and the life prolonging effects\) can be obtained without suffering and death of other beings, it is not a good argument for legitimizing hunting.
1.3.4.3.3. Con: There are various factors that prolong human life, many of them \(such as balanced diet or exercise\) more effective than happiness in prolonging one's life.
1.3.5. Pro: Trophy hunting requires high levels of technical skill, patience and dedication. Successfully possessing these traits naturally results in feelings of enjoyment because they represent significant achievement and/or mastery of difficulty.
1.3.5.1. Con: Hunting people would require high levels of technical skill, patience and dedication. This may result in enjoyment but is nonetheless not allowed. Trophy hunting should therefore also not be allowed using the metric of enjoyment.
1.3.5.2. Con: A level of enjoyment derived from the abuse of another is morally objectionable across all species.
1.3.5.2.1. Pro: Feeling enjoyment from abuse of another is a [personality disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadistic_personality_disorder) with high comorbidity with other personality disorders.
1.3.5.3. Con: These skills are wasted on harming others.
1.3.6. Con: A person should not pursue enjoyment by causing suffering and/or death in other living beings.
1.3.6.1. Pro: There are other ways of gaining "considerable enjoyment" without causing suffering to living beings.
1.3.6.1.1. Pro: [Surveys](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgebradt/2015/05/27/the-secret-of-happiness-revealed-by-harvard-study/#7b9727fd6786) of successful people in the US show that lasting happiness is based on good relationships.
1.3.6.1.2. Con: While people gain enjoyment from other activities some people derive considerable happiness from trophy hunting. Everyone should be free to pursue their personal conception of the good life.
1.3.6.1.2.1. Con: An individuals freedom to pursue an activity does not outweigh the right to life of a sentient being.
1.3.6.2. Con: Many people experience [enjoyment from eating meat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology_of_eating_meat), even though the process of producing meat involves animal suffering.
1.3.6.2.1. Con: Allowing one harmful activity in the status quo does not lead to the conclusion that all harmful activities must be allowed by the state.
1.3.6.2.2. Con: The enjoyment in this example comes from the taste of meat, not from the fact that an animal had to be killed for it.
1.3.6.3. Pro: Trophy hunting makes it acceptable to kill a living being for fun. There exist no other circumstances where this is considered permissible.
1.3.6.3.1. Pro: Killing for fun in any other way would be seen as murder and prosecuted accordingly. Trophy hunting should not be the exception.
1.3.6.3.1.1. Con: Murder is the killing of another human, not an animal, be that for fun or any other reason.
1.3.6.3.1.1.1. Pro: Human beings are rational, conscious and sentient. They possess the ability to see themselves as distinct entities through time and space and can therefore envisage long term interests. Only they therefore can have the [right to life](https://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/1979----.htm).
1.3.6.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Animals can also possess the ability to communicate in the case of [dolphins](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/dolphins-speak-language-human-communication-scientists-a7237791.html), the ability to sympathize with members of their own species in the case of [elephants](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/animal-emotions/201309/do-elephants-weep-emotional-response) and be extremely intelligent in the case of [octopuses](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/28/alien-intelligence-the-extraordinary-minds-of-octopuses-and-other-cephalopods). Just because they do not express themselves in the same way as humans do can not be a reason for them being killed unnecessarily.
1.3.6.3.1.1.1.2. Con: Human beings that are comatose or have certain mental illnesses may are not rational and can not envisage long term interests as well. Given that they are not killed for fun, animals should not either.
1.3.6.3.1.1.2. Con: Drawing a line on the basis of species is inherently arbitrary and is therefore morally irrelevant.
1.3.6.3.1.2. Pro: Murder may not be the right word for it, but killing any living animal for fun/amusement isn't right \(for survival it's plausible\). People don't agree when it happens to cats or dogs so why should it be ok with wild animals?
1.3.6.3.2. Pro: Hunting can not be classified as a sport.
1.3.6.3.2.1. Pro: Sports involve competition between two consenting parties and the mediation of a referee. Hunting does not involve either of these.
1.3.6.3.2.2. Pro: No sport ends with the deliberate death of one unwilling participant.
1.3.6.3.2.3. Con: A sport includes using a particular skill \(or set of skills\) to obtain a goal set forth with rules and regulations while competing against others. Trophy hunting fits within this guideline.
1.3.6.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.1.
1.3.6.3.4. Pro: Animals in slaughter houses, for example, are killed for the purpose of providing sustenance, not for sheer human entertainment.
1.3.6.3.4.1. Con: From the perspective of the individual animal being killed it makes no difference whether they were killed for food or for sport.
1.3.6.3.5. Pro: Trophy hunting means killing for no purpose other than entertainment and ego.
1.3.6.3.6. Pro: Living beings must only be killed when it is absolutely necessary to do so.
1.3.6.3.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.1.
1.3.6.3.6.2. Con: It seems difficult to define absolutely necessary. Humans do not strictly [need](https://www.peta.org/about-peta/faq/dont-we-need-to-eat-meat-and-dairy-products-to-be-healthy/) to eat meat to survive, in fact some [argue](https://www.peta.org/features/are-humans-supposed-to-eat-meat/) that we are not even designed to eat meat. Despite this no country in the world has banned the eating of meat.
1.3.6.3.6.2.1. Pro: In fact [56 billion](http://www.animalequality.net/food) farm animals are killed every year for food. If this is allowed, it seems inconsistent and misguided to focus on the comparatively tiny amount of animals killed by trophy hunters.
1.3.6.3.6.2.2. Pro: It is more accurate to say that animals must only be killed when doing so benefits people. It is clear that trophy hunting does so in a number of ways.
1.3.6.3.6.2.3. Con: It should not be assumed that the widespread killing of animals for food is ethical, or should not also be banned. Although it has not happened yet, [many](https://www.peta.org/) [groups](http://www.animalliberationfront.com/ALFront/Premise_History/RevolutionaryCells.htm) [do](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm_Animal_Rights_Movement) advocate against allowing the eating of meat.
1.3.6.3.6.2.4. Con: The fact that humans do not "need" meet is irrelevant to its use being banned by the state. Humans do not "need" a lot of things but the state does not ban these things using the metric of necessity.
1.3.6.3.6.3. Pro: Living beings can be killed in self defense.
1.3.6.3.6.4. Pro: Living beings can be killed when doing so is required for subsistence.
1.3.6.3.6.5. Pro: Utilitarian philosopher Peter Singer argues that all living beings have an [interest in living](https://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/1979----.htm); that is why even animals try to escape when being hunted. In the instance where killing is not necessary, this preference must be respected and fulfilled.
1.3.6.3.6.6. Con: A duty to not kill until absolutely  necessary is only extended to members of the [human species](https://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/1979----.htm) and rightly so.
1.3.6.3.6.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.3.1.1.1.
1.3.6.3.6.6.2. Con: -> See 1.3.6.3.1.1.2.
1.3.6.4. Pro: People gain considerable enjoyment from many activities that should be illegal, such as child sex and rape. The law exists to protect others from the "enjoyment" of psychopaths.
1.3.7. Pro: Hunting and killing animals for sport is an [ancient](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/hunting-big-game-why-people-kill-animals-for-fun/), and fundamental, human impulse.
1.3.7.1. Pro: In subsistence societies people often [target](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/hunting-big-game-why-people-kill-animals-for-fun/) fitter animals to demonstrate their prowess.
1.3.7.1.1. Con: Trophy hunters tend to select the biggest, fittest animals as these make the best trophies. This can have a catastrophic effect on the population as a whole.
1.3.7.1.1.1. Pro: The premise of trophy hunting is to hunt the [biggest/largest](https://www.raincoast.org/2017/03/hunting-for-status-men-trophy-hunt-as-a-signal-they-can-absorb-the-costs/) animal, with categories regarding animal weight, horn length, and height.
1.3.7.1.1.2. Pro: Selective hunting of the biggest or most fit males leads to the[loss](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/284/1868/20171788) of beneficial alleles, which can lead otherwise resilient populations to extinction.
1.3.7.1.1.2.1. Pro: This is [particularly relevant](http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/hunting-trophy-animals-species-extinction-conservation-genes-antlers-horns-tusks-a8080776.html) where these populations face existential threats such as climate change.
1.3.7.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: [“Trophy” animals](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/11/wildlife-watch-trophy-hunting-extinctions-evolution/) tend to be the most evolutionarily fit and possess the high-quality genes a population of animals need to adapt quickly to a changing environment.
1.3.7.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: [They](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/11/wildlife-watch-trophy-hunting-extinctions-evolution/) also father a high proportion of the offspring. But if they’re killed before they can spread their ‘good genes’ around, this reduces the overall fitness and resilience of that population.
1.3.7.1.1.2.1.1.2. Con: The [study](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/11/wildlife-watch-trophy-hunting-extinctions-evolution/) shows that restricting the take to older trophy males means that they will have had time to spread their good genes around, which should help populations adapt to environmental changes.
1.3.7.1.1.2.2. Pro: A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3479801/) of elk found that hunting selected for a "hide" adaptive strategy, and against a "run" strategy. Human induced behavioural change is dangerous as it may select against otherwise useful behaviours and thus reduce the fitness of the population.
1.3.7.1.1.2.3. Pro: The term "[Darwinian debt](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2702803/)" describes the fact that it may be hard for a population that has been hunted to recover even after hunting is stopped or reduced. This is because the period of hunting has selected strongly for maladaptive traits which reduces the fitness of the population.
1.3.7.1.1.2.4. Pro: Human predation has been shown to alter populations [far faster](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2630061/) than natural selection, meaning that trophy hunting could cause rapid shifts in population characteristics.
1.3.7.1.1.3. Con: All human interactions with nature shape nature. While trophy hunting may impact population characteristics many of these animals are under far greater threat from habitat loss, illegal poaching, and human wildlife conflict. Trophy hunting, by giving economic value to wild animals, mitigates these existential threats.
1.3.7.1.1.3.1. Con: Those greater threats wouldn't exist if the value of animal life was more important in society's moral framework, trophy hunting makes people think of animals as a products instead of sentient beings by giving them economic value, which creates a circle of violence that's worse for the animals in the long-run, regardless of the momentary benefits that trophy hunting might bring to them.
1.3.7.1.1.4. Con: There are ways to mitigate this effect, such as having "[no take zones](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2702803/)." Fit animals from these natural zones can migrate to and revitalise hunted populations.
1.3.7.1.1.4.1. Con: It is possible that hunting outside these "no take zones" may exert a selective pressure [against migration](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2702803/#B106). Thus the animals in these zones become isolated and do not travel to, and thus don't revitalise, the hunting areas.
1.3.7.1.2. Pro: For example the Meriam peoples of Australia traditionally hunt the green turtle. Where as men, women, and children collect them when they come to shore to lay eggs, only the men hunt the turtle at sea \(which is dangerous\). This is arguably to [gain prestige](http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/13/3/20160909).
1.3.7.2. Con: Just because an activity has been performed for a long time, or even if it's a "natural" impulse for some doesn't mean it should be allowed.
1.3.7.3. Con: There are many ancient practices that are no longer suitable for modern day due to the evolution of human knowledge, ethics, and compassion.
1.3.7.3.1. Pro: As humans [evolve](https://phys.org/news/2009-12-social-scientists-case-survival-kindest.html) towards being more compassionate, trophy hunting may very well become obsolete.
1.3.7.4. Con: [Hunting and killing](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25067056?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) animal for sport was not an impulse, but an orchestrated public display of royal wealth and dominance by kings over beasts.
1.3.7.4.1. Pro: Hunting for survival and hunting for prestige have two different motivations. There are better ways to prove your worth to the group than putting down an animal.
1.3.7.5. Con: If people keep doing this, one day there will be no more animals to be hunted, thus the tradition will die anyway.
1.3.7.6. Con: An impulse to show power based on the morals and beliefs of the respective society, not something necessary. It is an subjective belief.
1.3.8. Con: A specimen of an endangered species must not be killed no matter what advantages one can get.
1.3.9. Con: There are other ways to get amused, trophy hunting is not necessary for this.
1.4. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.
1.5. Con: Trophy hunting is better for the environment than ecotourism.
1.5.1. Pro: Hunting can lead to [larger wildlife populations](http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/big-game-banning-trophy-hunting-could-do-more-harm-good/) because they are specifically managed to keep numbers higher. Larger animal populations are more resilient to extinction, and hunters have an interest in their protection. This contrasts with ecotourism where the presence of only a few individual animals is sufficient to ensure that the expectations of many paying tourists are met.
1.5.1.1. Con: Trophy hunting hurts populations of already vulnerable animal species.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: [Researchers](https://adventure.howstuffworks.com/outdoor-activities/hunting/game-handling/hunting-trophies4.htm) claim repeated hunting over many years has gradually diminished the size of the Kodiak bears of Alaska.
1.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: Furthermore, hunting has altered the bears' behavior in a [cause-and-effect manner](https://adventure.howstuffworks.com/outdoor-activities/hunting/game-handling/hunting-trophies4.htm). Because the bears have grown so frightened of humans, they are more likely to forego their normal salmon runs, thus undermining their own nutrition and health.
1.5.1.1.2. Pro: The International Union for Conservation of Nature, which monitors animal populations, [reports](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/10/trophy-hunting-killing-saving-animals/) that the number of lions in five populations in Tanzania fell by two-thirds from 1993 to 2014. Despite years of lion hunting being allowed, the lion population has plummeted.
1.5.1.1.2.1. Con: The decrease in lion numbers may have been due to other factors than trophy hunting.
1.5.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.11.
1.5.1.1.2.1.2. Con: The Lion Research Center at the University of Minnesota was able to [directly link](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2010.01576.x/abstract) sport hunting to the decline of lions in most of Tanzania's hunting area.
1.5.1.1.2.1.3. Pro: Trophy hunting has a minimal impact on the health of an overall species.
1.5.1.1.2.1.3.1. Pro: Legal elephant hunting casualties in southern Africa are [minuscule](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/science/elephants-lions-africa-hunting.html), accounting 0.1 to 0.23 percent of their respective populations in 2015.
1.5.1.1.2.1.3.2. Con: [Hunting](https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-in-entertainment/cruel-sports/hunting/) disrupts migration and hibernation patterns and destroys families. For animals such as wolves and geese, who mate for life and live in close-knit family units, hunting can devastate entire communities.
1.5.1.1.2.1.3.3. Pro: Based on a survey \([p.16](http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc610e.pdf)\) of 133 local experts in West Africa, trophy hunting came next to last in a ranking of 11 threats to wildlife, with poaching at the top, with the study concluding it has a negligible impact on the overall health of a species.
1.5.1.1.2.1.3.4. Con: [Hunters](https://www.thoughtco.com/is-hunting-ever-defensible-127868) out for trophies, such as elk and deer with large racks, usually kill the strongest and healthiest of the species, not the weak and starving they claim to put out of their misery.
1.5.1.1.2.1.3.4.1. Pro: This can drive genes that are less beneficial to survival to be expressed in species by eliminating stronger and more naturally desired genes.
1.5.1.1.2.1.3.4.1.1. Pro: [Elephant poaching](https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-in-entertainment/cruel-sports/hunting/) is believed to have increased the number of tuskless animals in Africa.
1.5.1.1.2.1.3.4.1.2. Pro: In [Canada](https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-in-entertainment/cruel-sports/hunting/), hunting has caused the bighorn sheep’s horn size to fall by 25 percent in the last 40 years.
1.5.1.1.2.1.3.5. Con: -> See 1.3.7.1.1.2.
1.5.1.1.2.1.3.6. Con: When an adult male lion is killed, the new alpha male [commits](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005941) infanticide, killing the children of the deceased male.
1.5.1.1.2.1.3.6.1. Pro: With the death of Cecil, conservationists fear Jericho, the other male co-leading 6 lionesses and 12 cubs, [may kill](http://r.srvtrck.com/v1/redirect?yk_tag=4b_5_df_78bc_51943x5469x&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fnews%2Fworld%2F2015%2F07%2F30%2Fzimbabwe-cecil-lion-dentist%2F30886959%2F&source=http%3A%2F%2Fwellmartstore.net%2Fproduct%2Fjeffrey-james-botanicals-the-firm-antioxidant-super-serum-2-oz%2F&api_key=abbc5236946676eae219a734c0a1c5e8&site_id=5100c007f7d1477d86b2635ac1c59c6a&type=url) those fathered by Cecil.
1.5.1.1.2.1.3.7. Con: As animals are mobile, the impact of trophy hunting can be far-reaching. The local depopulation from hunting leads to an influx of animals from [neighbouring areas](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0162610&type=printable), depleting their population in turn.
1.5.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.5.1.1.2.1.3.
1.5.1.1.4. Con: -> See 1.2.11.
1.5.1.1.5. Con: The Save Valley and Bubye Valley conservancies in Zimbabwe, which are primarily supported by hunting, [have resulted](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23461543) in the growth of the local lion population.
1.5.1.1.6. Pro: Taking [exotic “game” animals](https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-in-entertainment/cruel-sports/hunting/) to non-native environments for hunters to kill is another problem: If they’re able to escape and thrive, they can pose a threat to native wildlife and disrupt established ecosystems.
1.5.1.1.7. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.1.1.
1.5.1.1.8. Con: Trophy hunting helps maintain, protect and revive sustainable animal populations.
1.5.1.1.8.1. Con: It can be [difficult](http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/big-game-banning-trophy-hunting-could-do-more-harm-good/) to determine just how many animals can be sustainably killed.
1.5.1.1.8.2. Pro: A scientifically-based program in Pakistan that included trophy hunting led to a substantial increase in the endangered [Markhor goat](https://sites.utexas.edu/wildlife/2014/11/25/hunting-saves-a-the-markhor/) population. This in turn, boosted the population of snow leopards, another vulnerable species.
1.5.1.1.8.2.1. Pro: The funds from trophy hunting used to help conserve [Markhor goats](https://www.fws.gov/news/ShowNews.cfm?ID=E6D8E1A2-FF83-1C13-22322580A454755D) succeeded in doing so, seeing an increase in population from 200 to 3,500.
1.5.1.1.8.2.2. Pro: From 1989 to 2007, Chitral Gal saw a [12% increase](https://sites.utexas.edu/wildlife/2014/11/25/hunting-saves-a-the-markhor/) in Markhor goat population with trophy hunting.
1.5.1.1.8.3. Con: Trophy hunting can destabilize the natural order of a species.
1.5.1.1.8.3.1. Pro: When an [adult male lion](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/08/130802-lions-trophy-hunting-extinction-opinion-animals-africa-conservation/?rptregcta=reg_free_np&rptregcampaign=20131016_rw_membership_r1p_us_dr_w#) is killed, it destabilizes the pride by allowing outside males to take over. This leads to competition and the deaths of more lions within the pride.
1.5.1.1.8.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.2.1.3.6.1.
1.5.1.1.8.3.2. Pro: Hunting male animals causes social reorganisation in some carnivorous species, bringing new male animals into contact with the cubs of the hunted males. This encourages infanticide and thus has an impact upon the [entire population](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4262167/#RSPB20141840C21).
1.5.1.1.8.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.2.1.3.6.
1.5.1.1.8.4. Pro: Trophy hunting often allows for the euthanization of unhealthy and aggressive males who are a prone to harming younger females of the same species.
1.5.1.1.8.4.1. Con: In the [case](http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-1136034) of Namibia and elephant hunting, these permits are often handed out before an animal has been identified, allowing the hunter to shoot any animal which a community defines as a problem, regardless of whether this is so in reality.
1.5.1.1.8.4.2. Con: -> See 1.5.1.1.2.1.3.4.
1.5.1.1.8.4.3. Con: [Older bulls](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/10/trophy-hunting-killing-saving-animals/) exert a very important regulatory impact on the herd and an emotional-social influence on the younger bulls. Younger bulls in musth, a heightened state of aggression during which testosterone levels can be 10 times as high as normal, will be more likely to fight each other when an older bull is absent.
1.5.1.1.8.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.2.
1.5.1.1.8.6. Pro: Revenues of hundreds of millions in federal excise taxes levied on hunters go directly to wildlife management and related activities each year in the [U.S.](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/10/trophy-hunting-killing-saving-animals/) alone.
1.5.1.1.8.7. Pro: Trophy hunts can \(and do\) target animals that are detrimental to their species, such as an impotent male killing fertile competition or otherwise jeopardizing the herd. [National Geographic](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/03/070315-hunting-africa.html) and [WWF](https://conservationaction.co.za/resources/reports/lions-share-economic-benefits-trophy-hunting/) both claim it can help, but it must be judged case-by-case and strictly regulated. One specific example is the rhino [Number 65](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-12-09/saving-the-rhino-through-sacrifice) who had claimed a herd of cows but was unable to impregnate them.
1.5.1.1.8.8. Pro: Hunting is an effective form of [deer management](https://www.thoughtco.com/is-hunting-ever-defensible-127868) because it will remove a number of individual deer from a population and prevent those individuals from reproducing. Since natural deer predators have been eliminated in many areas, hunters argue that hunting is necessary to perform the function of wolves or cougars in keeping the deer population in check.
1.5.1.1.9. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.2.1.3.6.
1.5.1.1.10. Pro: The [Allee effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allee_effect) renders some wildlife particularly vulnerable. From a variety of mechanisms, including genetic and social \(e.g. cooperation\), reducing the density of an animal population can leave the remaining individuals less able to survive in their environment. Thus trophy hunting could have a greater than expected impact on a population.
1.5.1.1.10.1. Pro: Trophy hunting in particular drives the ["anthropomorphic Allee effect"](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040415&type=printable). As an animal becomes rarer its value goes up to trophy hunters, encouraging legal or illegal procurement. This positive feedback loop can drive a species to extinction.
1.5.1.1.10.2. Con: A number of human [activities](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040415&type=printable), including eco-tourism, were found to be drivers of this effect. There is no particular reason to single out trophy hunting, which, if anything, is likely easier to regulate with quotas than other activities \(tourism, collecting exotic pets, dietary consumption, etc.\).
1.5.1.1.11. Pro: Numerous animals are under threat from trophy hunting.
1.5.1.1.11.1. Pro: At the rate they are trophy hunted, southern male [African bull elephants](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jwmg.641/full) will disappear from the wild in 10 years.
1.5.1.1.11.2. Pro: [Giraffes](https://www.globalanimal.org/2017/04/20/giraffes-in-trouble-trophy-hunting-tourists-trigger-silent-extinction/) currently face extinction due to trophy hunting.
1.5.1.1.11.3. Pro: Sports hunting had a [negative impact](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid%3Af45bb0ae-accd-46ed-aec3-397dd05ca7d4) on the African lion population, pushing it to the[brink of extinction](http://www.humanesociety.org/news/magazines/2016/01-02/trophy-hunting-devastation.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/).
1.5.1.1.11.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.2.
1.5.1.1.11.4. Pro: Trophy hunting of leopards in Tanzania has resulted in a noticeable [decline](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20825444) in the species population.
1.5.1.1.11.4.1. Pro: Even killing male leopards, who do not directly care for the young, could have an amplified impact on the population. This is because the presence of the paternal male will [reduce the risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_leopard) that other males will kill their young.
1.5.1.1.11.4.2. Pro: While trophy hunting female leopards in Tanzania [is illegal](https://www.africahunting.com/threads/tanzania-hunting-information.14227/), in the past [~25%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_leopard) of the animals killed were in fact female. Killing female animals can have a particularly deleterious effect on the population as they care for the young.
1.5.1.1.11.5. Pro: US states with the highest intensity for sports hunting have shown the steepest population [decline](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005941) in cougars.
1.5.1.1.11.6. Con: On net it is predicted that wildlife populations will decline by[67% globally by 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2016/oct/27/worlds-wildlife-being-pushed-to-the-edge-by-humans-in-pictures). A tiny fraction of these animals are under threat from trophy hunting, most are under threat indirectly from human activity \(e.g. pollution\).
1.5.1.1.11.6.1. Con: The vast majority of animals may be threatened by things other than trophy hunting, however it is perfectly consistent to crack down on those causes alongside battling trophy hunting.
1.5.1.1.12. Pro: Lots of endangered species are only endangered because humans are destroying their habitat, and that will continue to happen until somebody is willing to pay more money than can potentially be made from that habitat. Especially breeding a few specimen each year specifically to sell to trophy hunters would bring in the money needed to buy land needed to rebuild endangered species.
1.5.2. Pro: Before the ivory ban of 2014, hunters were [undeterred](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/science/elephants-lions-africa-hunting.html) by political turmoil in Zimbabwe while tourism suffered a decade-long decline.
1.5.3. Pro: Ecotourism often has far [greater upfront costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/science/elephants-lions-africa-hunting.html) in building the necessary infrastructure compared to trophy hunting, making it inaccessible to many communities.
1.5.4. Con: Ecotourism generates [far more](http://www.endangeredspecieshandbook.org/persecution_trophyecotourism.php) income than trophy hunting. This provides a more powerful incentive to protect the environment.
1.5.4.1. Pro: The money from trophy hunting comes from large payments from a few individuals. In contrast the money from eco-tourism comes as smaller payments from a large number of individuals. The latter is far more likely to generate [money for a community](http://www.endangeredspecieshandbook.org/persecution_trophyecotourism.php) as they all need to buy hotels, taxis, and food.
1.5.5. Con: Trophy hunting augments, rather than replaces, ecotourism. Even if trophy hunting increases, ecotourism is unlikely to decline.
1.5.5.1. Pro: There are very few dedicated trophy hunters, [relative](http://www.endangeredspecieshandbook.org/persecution_trophyecotourism.php) to ecotourists. Most of the impact from tourist travel is because of ecotourists, not trophy hunters.
1.5.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.4.3.1.4.
1.5.6. Pro: Ecotourism can have a greater negative impact on the environment.
1.5.6.1. Pro: Trophy hunting can also have a smaller carbon and infrastructure footprint than [ecotourism](http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/big-game-banning-trophy-hunting-could-do-more-harm-good/) because it requires fewer paying customers for the same amount of revenue.
1.5.6.1.1. Pro: Fewer customers means less fuel used to transport tourists onsite.
1.5.6.2. Pro: Hunters typically[relish](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/science/elephants-lions-africa-hunting.html) spending time in the rugged wilderness which lack roads, cellphone service and treated water among other amenities.
1.5.6.2.1. Con: Time spent in the wilderness, away from modern conveniences can be enjoyed without the killing of an animal, via camping or nature tours for example.
1.5.6.3. Pro: Tourists [expect](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/science/elephants-lions-africa-hunting.html) a nice bed and lodge, along with electricity and pure water, all facilities which require a negative impact on the environment to build.
1.6. Pro: Trophy hunting is unethical.
1.6.1. Con: By obeying laws and killing free-range animals in a manner that does not give humans an “improper advantage” over their prey, the activity constitutes “fair chase.”
1.6.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.4.1.
1.6.2. Con: Hunting itself may be unpleasant, but the life led in their natural habitat, before being hunted, is far better than the life of a farmed animal.
1.6.2.1. Con: That life would have been even better had it been allowed to continue rather than being cut short due to trophy hunting.
1.6.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.
1.6.2.3. Con: The two should not be compared, as farmed animals and those hunted for trophy sport both suffer at the hands of human enjoyment.
1.6.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.2.
1.6.2.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.8.
1.6.2.4. Pro: Animals hunted for trophy are in their natural habitat and freely able to roam, unlike many farm-raised animals.
1.6.2.5. Pro: Animals hunted for trophies are able to eat their natural diet, which supports their health as intended. Conversely farm animals are fed a diet of genetically modified grains to support quickly preparing them for human consumption.
1.6.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.
1.6.4. Pro: Trophy hunting perpetuates the immoral ideals that already plague the Western world.
1.6.4.1. Pro: Trophy hunting represents continued [colonial ideals](https://www.commonspace.scot/articles/2048/cecil-lion-hunting-and-legacy-colonialism-africa-q-leading-academic) which we should be removing from Western societies.
1.6.4.1.1. Pro: Historian Dr Angela Thompsell argues that safaris have strong [colonial tones](https://www.commonspace.scot/articles/2048/cecil-lion-hunting-and-legacy-colonialism-africa-q-leading-academic). One example she gives is the ability of white men to move to places where hunting occurs and become famous guides has strong colonial echoes.
1.6.4.1.1.1. Con: [Dr. Angela Thompsell](https://www.commonspace.scot/articles/2048/cecil-lion-hunting-and-legacy-colonialism-africa-q-leading-academic) also says though that one of the most significant differences between hunting in the colonial era and hunting in modern times is how hunters are depicted in the media and mainstream Western society. Where big game hunters were once celebrated for their alleged prowess, they are now more often condemned.
1.6.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: This is primarily a result of [Western culture's](https://www.commonspace.scot/articles/2048/cecil-lion-hunting-and-legacy-colonialism-africa-q-leading-academic) increased concern for conservation.
1.6.4.1.2. Pro: British Colombia used to allow trophy hunting of bears, which went directly [against the wishes](http://coastalfirstnations.ca/coastal-first-nations-central-coast-bear-working-group-reacts-bc-government-announcement-ban-trophy-bear-hunt/) of the Coastal First Nations \(a representative group for the indigenous people of the region\). In this case trophy hunting represented a direct imposition on their cultural values.
1.6.4.1.3. Pro: [60%](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AZlAR4Qonk) of all trophy hunters in Tanzania come from the United States of America, a Western power.
1.6.4.1.4. Con: Arguably the bans on trophy hunting, generally from Western countries, are [an example](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/10/trophy-hunting-killing-saving-animals/) of neo-colonialism. The West is controlling the resources of, and dictating to, African countries.
1.6.4.1.4.1. Con: By this logic, any sort of sanction imposed on any African country by the "West" would be an act of neo-colonialism.
1.6.4.1.4.2. Con: This does not take into account whether or not such a ban is objectively good or bad, it only looks at the actor that is banning it.
1.6.4.1.4.2.1. Con: The actor making the decision is part of the objective assessment of whether a decision is good. The impact of a colonial power making a decision to ban an activity that takes place in a former colony is very different from the same country self-determining, even if the action is the same.
1.6.4.2. Pro: Trophy hunting reinforces a [desire](http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/13/3/20160909) for power and dominance \(often expressed through [violence](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/editorials/cecil-the-lion-death-white-men-go-to-africa-to-prove-their-manhood-at-a-cost-10425316.html)\) that is [characteristic of toxic masculinity](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1470593109355250?journalCode=mtqa).
1.6.4.2.1. Pro: Hunting has [historically](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/masculinity-and-the-hunt-9780199657117?cc=us&lang=en&#) served as a metaphor for a man's romantic pursuit, as he pursues elusive quarry \(either a female romantic interest, or animal prey\) over which he ultimately comes to assert control.
1.6.4.2.2. Con: Modern hunting has a [growing number](https://www.range365.com/more-women-are-hunting-say-survey-results) of female hunters.
1.6.4.3. Pro: The West tends to view nature as an obstacle to exploit and dominate, rather than living synergistically with or depending on the environment. Trophy hunting, which exploits animals for human pleasure, is a manifestation of this mindset.
1.6.4.3.1. Pro: Some people in the Judeo-Christian tradition have [interpreted](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/the-genesis-creation-story-permission-to-despoil/) the mandate in Genesis to "subdue \[the earth\]: and have dominion over...every living thing that moves upon the earth" as justification for a mindset that fosters policies that are exploitative and destructive for the environment.
1.6.4.3.1.1. Con: Many religious texts allow for humans to use nature for their own ends.
1.6.4.3.2. Pro: The [Industrial Revolution](http://www.ecology.com/2011/09/18/ecological-impact-industrial-revolution/), beginning in the Great Britain, was incredibly destructive to the environment, but was embraced by the Western world because it provided monetary benefit.
1.6.4.3.2.1. Con: The climatic effects of the industrial revolution were not understood by Western states at the point of initiation.
1.6.4.3.3. Con: Well managed trophy hunting involves living synergistically with the environment. It requires the maintenance of large areas of wild environment, which humans interact with in a limited manner. This is far less exploitative of nature than alternatives such as farming or luxury tourism.
1.6.4.3.4. Con: All human societies have viewed nature as something that needs to be exploited; the exploitation of nature allows humans to survive.
1.6.4.4. Con: The idea of hunting animals to demonstrate prowess, or affluence, is not a Western construction, and is found in many cultures [throughout history](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-men-trophy-hunt-showing-off-and-the-psychology_us_58dae9efe4b0487a198a5531).
1.6.4.4.1. Con: Trophy hunting, as it is understood in the modern world, is grounded primarily in colonialism and the encounters of colonialists with "nature" in colonies.
1.6.4.5. Pro: Perpetuating the obsolete belief that humans have been deeded the planet and all its inhabitants to dispose of at will leads to unsustainability and an unhealthy mentality.
1.6.5. Pro: According to [a survey in the US](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:EMuShC7xF_AJ:www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/7/11/83/pdf+&cd=11&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us), only 37% of people agreed that it was acceptable to hunt for a trophy.
1.6.5.1. Con: [Reputable organizations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AZlAR4Qonk) like the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the World Wildlife Fund officially support regulated hunting as a positive for conservationists and local communities.
1.6.5.2. Con: The photographs from trophy hunting make eye-catching, and to many distressing, headlines. What does not make headlines is the role of trophy hunting in conservation, local economies, and environmental protection. This explains the public's view, which is not necessarily grounded on sound moral or consequential judgement.
1.6.5.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.3.
1.6.5.2.2. Con: [Corrupt officials](http://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/eij/article/hunting_is_a_setback_to_wildlife_conservation/) allow animals to be killed in dangerously high numbers – to the point of harming the conservation of the species.
1.6.6. Con: -> See 1.3.7.
1.6.7. Pro: Humans have rights [because](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/introduction/endinitself.shtml) they are ends onto themselves rather than means to an end, which would also apply to animals as they are both subject of a life.
1.6.7.1. Pro: Animals and humans are very [similar](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/animals/rights/rights_1.shtml) biologically.
1.6.7.2. Pro: Animals are [conscious](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/animal-emotions/201208/scientists-conclude-nonhuman-animals-are-conscious-beings) and aware of what is happening to them.
1.6.7.2.1. Pro: Animals are [capable](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/animals/rights/rights_1.shtml) of conscious decisions, preferring certain things over others.
1.6.7.2.1.1. Pro: Animals actively try to preserve their own lives.
1.6.7.2.1.1.1. Pro: Animals being hunted run away from their predators and try to preserve their life.
1.6.7.3. Pro: The quality and length of an animal's life matters to it.
1.6.7.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.7.2.1.1.
1.6.7.3.2. Con: Ingrained responses do not indicate consciousness. Some plants respond to the vibrations of insects eating them. This does not make them conscious, nor should it endow them with rights \(vibration sense from [Appel and Cocroft 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4102826/)\).
1.6.7.3.2.1. Con: Ingrained responses don't indicate the absence of consciousness.
1.6.7.4. Con: [Nature](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/natural-rights.html) endows every human \(without any distinction of time or space, and without any regard to age, gender, nationality, or race\) with certain inalienable rights, such as the right to 'life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness'.
1.6.7.5. Con: Many justifications of human rights wouldn't apply to animals. For example: that they are a product of a legal framework, derive from a supreme being, or emerge from human norms \([James, N. 2017](https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/rights-human)\)
1.6.8. Pro: Trophy hunting creates an economy that supports detrimental \(to society, the environment, etc.\) industries such as guns, hunting, and flying \(high fuel usage\). Trophy hunting also creates more costs for beneficial services such as protecting endangered species.
1.6.9. Pro: Trophy hunting creates a negative image for the nations that do not counteract it.
1.6.9.1. Con: The sex industry and many others may have the same effect. That is no reason for this to be immoral.
1.6.10. Pro: Trophy hunting causes suffering to the hunted animal and the ecosystem it is part of. This suffering is greater than the pleasure it gives to the hunter. That makes trophy hunting unethical.
1.6.10.1. Pro: The fear and the inescapable, earsplitting noises from the gunfire and other commotion that hunters create cause hunted animals to suffer tremendous stress.
1.6.10.1.1. Pro: [This](https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-in-entertainment/cruel-sports/hunting/) severely compromises their routine and their eating habits, making it hard for them to store the fat and energy that they need to survive the winter.
1.6.10.1.2. Pro: [Loud noises](https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-in-entertainment/cruel-sports/hunting/) can disrupt mating rituals and can cause parent animals to flee their dens and nests, leaving their young vulnerable to natural predators.
1.6.10.1.3. Con: The pain and fear caused by being hunted by predators is no less gruesome and horrific, yet we have no issue with this. It is thus unclear why pain felt by animals is sufficient grounds to ban trophy hunting.
1.6.10.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.3.6.3.
1.6.10.1.3.2. Con: Unlike animals, humans can consider moral positions. This makes us uniquely accountable to our ethical principles. Thus we can hold humans to different standards of behaviour.
1.6.10.1.3.3. Con: Being hunted by predators is different to being hunted by humans wielding guns. The suffering caused by the noise from gunfire does not exist for a hunt by natural predators.
1.6.10.2. Pro: Trophy hunting only serves to accumulate status on the part of hunters at the expense of an animal's life.
1.6.10.2.1. Pro: Hunters will often show off their kills by posting pictures to social media and hanging the animals heads on walls as trophies.
1.6.10.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.1.1.1.
1.6.10.2.3. Con: Accumulating status is a central, and legitimate, human ambition. We allow people to do it in all sorts of ways that directly or indirectly harm animals.
1.6.10.2.3.1. Pro: Choosing to build a house in the country \(a status symbol in many countries\) can disrupt ecosystems and threaten wildlife in a number of [complex ways](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.548.271&rep=rep1&type=pdf).
1.6.10.2.3.2. Con: -> See 1.3.6.2.1.
1.6.10.2.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.1.
1.6.10.3. Pro: Quick kills are rare, and many animals suffer prolonged, [painful deaths](https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-in-entertainment/cruel-sports/hunting/) when hunters severely injure but fail to kill them.
1.6.10.3.1. Pro: Methods used to kill the animals are [rarely humane](https://www.thoughtco.com/is-hunting-ever-defensible-127868). While a bullet straight to the heart or between the eyes may kill an animal instantly, not many hunters are that skilled and often the animal is tracked down because of the blood trail they leave.
1.6.10.3.1.1. Pro: Trophy hunting relies on methods such as [baiting, hounding, and trapping](http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/trophy_hunting/?referrer=https://www.google.com/), which often leaves the animal being hunted exhausted or injured until they are killed.
1.6.10.3.2. Pro: The Maine BowHunters Alliance [estimates](https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-in-entertainment/cruel-sports/hunting/) that 50 percent of animals who are shot with crossbows are wounded but not killed.
1.6.10.3.3. Pro: A [study](https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-in-entertainment/cruel-sports/hunting/) of 80 radio-collared white-tailed deer found that of the 22 deer who had been shot with “traditional archery equipment,” 11 were wounded but not recovered by hunters.
1.6.10.3.4. Pro: A [British study](https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-in-entertainment/cruel-sports/hunting/) of deer hunting found that 11 percent of deer killed by hunters died only after being shot two or more times and that some wounded deer suffered for more than 15 minutes before dying.
1.6.10.3.5. Pro: 20% of [foxes](https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-in-entertainment/cruel-sports/hunting/) wounded by hunters are shot again; 10% manage to escape.
1.6.10.3.6. Con: -> See 1.6.2.
1.6.10.3.7. Con: Members of the hunting community [recognise this](https://adventure.howstuffworks.com/outdoor-activities/hunting/principles/hunting-with-respect-for-life2.htm) and aim for kinder methods.
1.6.10.3.8. Con: -> See 1.6.10.1.3.
1.6.10.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.3.
1.6.10.5. Con: You cannot quantify the pleasure of killing by the hunter with the quantity of suffering by the prey.
If you choose to, then quantify the benefit of livestock and eating meat with animal suffering vs dietary pleasure for us.
1.7. Con: Trophy hunting helps conservation efforts.
1.7.1. Con: Some [forms](http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/big-game-banning-trophy-hunting-could-do-more-harm-good/) of trophy hunting have debatable value for conservation. For instance, “canned lion hunting”, where lions are bred and raised in captivity only to be shot in specially made enclosures, provides no incentive for conserving lions in the wild.
1.7.1.1. Con: Rather it provides an alternative to hunting wild lions. Instead of killing a wild animal, a captive one is killed instead, preserving the wild populations.
1.7.1.1.1. Pro: Canned hunting allows hunters to have the experience of trophy hunting in the wild while having a neutral effect on the wild as a whole.
1.7.1.1.2. Con: The lions in captivity would better help conservation efforts if they were released into the wild, to build the population. By breeding them just to kill, trophy hunters are still contributing to prolonging conservation efforts.
1.7.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.
1.7.2. Pro: While revenue from wildlife sightseeing is good, in most cases [effective conservation](http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/big-game-banning-trophy-hunting-could-do-more-harm-good/) requires much more.
1.7.2.1. Pro: According to [a WWF study](http://www.conservationmagazine.org/2015/10/what-if-we-banned-trophy-hunting-in-africa/), of 52 conservancies that had any sort of financial benefit from wildlife, more than half derived all or almost all those benefits from hunting.
1.7.2.2. Pro: Without more funding creating incentives to conserve wildlife, many natural habitats will be converted to farmland, which is generally much worse for native wildlife and the entire ecosystem.
1.7.3. Con: -> See 1.5.1.1.2.
1.7.4. Con: -> See 1.5.1.1.2.1.3.2.
1.7.5. Pro: Focused management of trophy hunting land can make them beneficial [conservation zones](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acv.12144/full) for herbivores.
1.7.6. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.2.1.3.
1.7.7. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.8.
1.7.8. Con: The [Namibian government](http://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/eij/article/hunting_is_a_setback_to_wildlife_conservation/) decided to allow the slaughter of a black rhino as a fundraising mechanism, but those funds will not necessarily go back to black rhino conservation as some claim. Instead, they will go into a general pot of money allocated to all manner of projects including those that have nothing to do with rhinos, or which could even be harmful to rhinos, such as “rural development.”
1.7.9. Con: Trophy hunting comes at the cost of eco-tourism which is better for local communities and thus better for conservation.
1.7.9.1. Con: -> See 1.5.
1.7.9.2. Pro: The existence of trophy hunting makes an area less appealing for eco-tourists.
1.7.9.2.1. Pro: Eco-tourists find the [sights and sounds](http://www.endangeredspecieshandbook.org/persecution_trophyecotourism.php) of trophy hunting distressing.
1.7.9.2.2. Pro: Trophy hunting [makes the animals](http://www.endangeredspecieshandbook.org/persecution_trophyecotourism.php) both more dangerous and less likely to approach eco-tourists.
1.7.9.2.2.1. Pro: Several tourists have been killed by [charging African Elephants](http://www.endangeredspecieshandbook.org/persecution_trophyecotourism.php) in areas where the animals had been trophy hunted.
1.7.9.3. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.
1.7.9.4. Pro: Even the loss of a single animal can be costly. The death of Cecil the Lion has been [predicted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Cecil_the_lion) to have caused a considerable loss, as people previously visited specifically to see Cecil.
1.7.9.4.1. Pro: Many [tourists](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/07/30/zimbabwe-cecil-lion-dentist/30886959/) had to cancel trips to Hwange National Park made specifically to see Cecil the lion.
1.7.9.5. Con: A study conducted on 77 CBNRM \(program in Namibia that allows communities to register land as communal conservancies\) [found](http://www.conservationmagazine.org/2015/10/what-if-we-banned-trophy-hunting-in-africa/) that most conservancies need both hunting and ecotourism to benefit from their wildlife.
1.7.9.5.1. Pro: Between 2011 and 2013 hunting operations[paid](http://www.conservationmagazine.org/2015/10/what-if-we-banned-trophy-hunting-in-africa/) $5.41 million while ecotourism only paid $2.13 million.
1.7.9.5.2. Pro: When looking at the sources of income, researchers [found](http://www.conservationmagazine.org/2015/10/what-if-we-banned-trophy-hunting-in-africa/) that 74% of conservancies had income that was greater than operating expenses. If hunting were to be banned, only 16% of these conservancies would remain in the black, versus 59% if ecotourism was banned.
1.7.9.5.3. Pro: Trophy hunting appears to lead to benefits [faster](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cobi.12643/full) than tourism, meaning that it plays a crucial role in the setting up of areas to protect wildlife.
1.7.9.5.4. Pro: Trophy hunting [sustained areas](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cobi.12643/full) that were unappealing or unaccessible to tourists.
1.7.9.6. Pro: -> See 1.5.6.
1.7.10. Pro: In [Tanzania](http://www.wildlife-baldus.com/download/hunting_wma.pdf), incentives from trophy hunting have been partially responsible for the decision of 50 of 80 villages neighboring Selous Game Reserve to create Wildlife Management Areas where sustainable wildlife utilization is the primary land use.
1.7.11. Pro: Trophy hunting has a unique benefit: it gives wildlife a monetary value in almost any location \(as it could be hunted\). This provides an [incentive](http://www.africanwildlifeconservationfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Economic-and-conservation-significance.pdf) to preserve wildlife outside the confines of a national park \(i.e. in land that is used for grazing\).
1.7.11.1. Con: This preservation at best is short term. The animals are being preserved so someone else can kill them.
1.7.11.1.1. Con: The same incentive that exists to preserve the animal initially remains when allowing trophy hunting. It makes economic sense to protect a healthy population of these animals so that trophy hunting can continue to generate revenue in future.
1.7.11.2. Pro: Researchers have predicted that even banning trophy hunting of a [single species](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029332&__hstc=87939463.f5dc8090e59056af30dbc3eba086b1ba.1474934400088.1474934400090.1474934400091.2&__hssc=87939463.1.1474934400091&__hsfp=1773666937), lions, could have a devastating effect on wildlife populations as it makes it no longer viable to protect land for trophy hunting.
1.7.12. Con: In some countries, [CITES](https://www.cites.org/eng/resources/quotas/index.php) restrictions on trophy exports impose limitations on revenues from trophy hunting and thus incentives for conservation. In West Africa, for example, several species of key importance for marketing hunting are not on quota \([pg.8](http://www.africanwildlifeconservationfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Economic-and-conservation-significance.pdf)\).
1.7.13. Pro: -> See 1.2.11.
1.7.14. Pro: Trophy hunting directly generates revenue for conservation efforts.
1.7.14.1. Pro: In several African countries, there has been a gradual alignment of trophy hunting industries with conservation and development policies, supported by a number of international donor agencies.
1.7.14.1.1. Pro: This happened first in southern Africa as part of the Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources \[[CAMPFIRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communal_Areas_Management_Programme_for_Indigenous_Resources)\] program in Zimbabwe and Administrative Management Design program \[[ADMADE](http://www.conservationgis.org/ctsp/admade/admade.html)\] in Zambia, and then in Central Africa through the Programme de De´veloppement des Zones de Chasse Villagesoise \[PDZCV\] in CAR and Zones d’Inte´ reˆ t Cyne´ge´tique a` Gestion Communautaire \[ZICGC\] in Cameroon \([pg.1](http://www.africanwildlifeconservationfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Economic-and-conservation-significance.pdf)\).
1.7.14.2. Pro: According to [a study by the WWF](http://www.conservationmagazine.org/2015/10/what-if-we-banned-trophy-hunting-in-africa/), only 16% of conservancies would have been able to pay all their bills if they were deprived of hunting-related income
1.7.14.2.1. Pro: Before a [hunting ban](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/christopher-clark/beneath-the-surface-of-th_b_8213258.html) was imposed in 2013, 60% of the Zambian Wildlife Authority’s \(ZAWA\) revenue was generated by commercial hunting. Today, ZAWA is underfunded and has been bailed out by the Zambian government more than once.
1.7.14.2.2. Pro: The [Bubye Valley Conservancy](http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-34116488) in Zimbabwe has more than 400 lions and one of the most important populations of rhino still in existence. The Conservancy is funded entirely by hunting and, according to the reserve manager Blondie Leathem, a ban would be "devastating".
1.7.14.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.9.5.
1.7.14.4. Pro: -> See 1.7.14.2.2.
1.7.14.5. Pro: -> See 1.7.14.2.1.
1.7.14.6. Con: -> See 1.7.8.
1.7.14.7. Con: Beyond the ethical or moral issues, there are still many concerns about trophy hunting that currently limit its use as a conservation tool. One of the [biggest problems](http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/big-game-banning-trophy-hunting-could-do-more-harm-good/) is that the revenue it generates often goes to the private sector rather than distributing benefits to conservation and local communities.
1.7.14.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.8.
1.7.15. Con: -> See 1.7.14.7.
1.7.16. Pro: Leading wildlife conservation agencies including IUCN, CITES and WWF support well managed trophy hunting and recognise its role in conserving wildlife[IUCN SSC Guiding Principles on Trophy Hunting as a Tool for Creating Conservation Incentives](https://portals.iucn.org/library/efiles/documents/Rep-2012-007.pdf)
1.7.17. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.8.7.
1.8. Pro: Trophy hunting poses unacceptable levels of risk for humans.
1.8.1. Pro: According to information released by the[International Hunter Education Association](https://accident.laws.com/hunting-accidents), the U.S. and Canada combined see around 1,000 hunting accidents, specifically involving shooting injuries, on an annual basis. Moreover, close to 10% of these hunting accidents end in death.
1.8.1.1. Con: Hunting may appear dangerous but actual rates of hunting injury per participant are [very low](http://www.semissourian.com/blogs/davis/entry/46599) compared to other activities.
1.8.2. Con: Many sports, such a football which has been shown to be dangerous, are still legal despite the injuries one may potentially face. Trophy hunting is no different.
1.8.2.1. Con: Only [12 football players die](http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/average-12-school-football-players-die-year-study-article-1.1309671) each year in comparison to 100 hunters, making hunting significantly more dangerous.
1.8.2.2. Con: Unlike sports, which only is dangerous to those who willingly participate, hunting may endanger the entire community and innocent bystanders.
1.8.2.2.1. Pro: In a community in Eastern Cape Karoo \(South Africa\), where farms were being converted into hunting areas, workers, their children, and their families were afforded few protections. Even fences, to protect these families going about their daily lives, [were absent](https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/opinionista/2015-11-17-trophy-hunting-in-south-africa-risky-business-for-whom/).
1.8.3. Pro: Trophy hunters around the world, even experienced ones, have been killed in hunting accidents.
1.8.3.1. Pro: In May 2017, [a South African hunter](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/21/south-african-hunter-crushed-death-elephant/) who regularly led hunts and tours was crushed by an elephant on a game reserve after accidentally getting too near a group of elephants.
1.8.3.2. Pro: In 2015, professional hunter [Ian Gibson](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/04/17/hunter-ian-gibson-trampled-death-elephant-tracking-kill_n_7085374.html) was trampled to death while leading a hunting tour.
1.8.3.3. Pro: In 2012, [Safari Classics](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/04/17/hunter-ian-gibson-trampled-death-elephant-tracking-kill_n_7085374.html) lost a hunter after an accident involving a buffalo.
1.8.3.4. Con: Humans are free to face the risks if they choose to do so.
1.8.4. Pro: These risks are [disproportionally borne](https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/opinionista/2015-11-17-trophy-hunting-in-south-africa-risky-business-for-whom/) by the locals who work within the industry, who have few protections from the dangerous wildlife they have to work alongside.
1.8.4.1. Pro: Worsening [the risk](https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/opinionista/2015-11-17-trophy-hunting-in-south-africa-risky-business-for-whom/), many of these workers may lack medical insurance, life insurance, or employment benefits.
1.8.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.2.2.1.
1.8.5. Con: Trophy hunting is lethal for the hunted animals. The people who voluntarily participate in this bloodsport thus willingly accept the risk of loss of life and limb.
1.8.5.1. Con: Not wearing a seat belt can prove lethal too. Just because drivers know the possible consequences of not wearing a seat belt does not mean that a state should not regulate the wearing of seat belts, especially when it prevents unnecessary bodily harm and possibly death.
1.8.6. Con: -> See 1.8.3.4.
1.8.7. Con: If one wishes to take a risk, it's clearly acceptable to them.
1.8.8. Pro: Approximately 100 people die in [hunting accidents](https://www.thoughtco.com/hunting-accident-rates-127877) in the United States every year, endangering a significant number of people in the community.
1.8.8.1. Con: Those numbers are for the United States and may not accurately represent the risk of trophy hunting, which happens on a much smaller scale.
1.8.8.1.1. Pro: By August of 2017 there were[3 deaths](https://www.care2.com/causes/karma-another-trophy-hunter-has-been-killed-by-an-elephant.html) related to trophy hunting that year \(only accounting trophy hunters themselves\), which is quite small.
1.8.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.4.
1.9. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.
1.10. Pro: The restrictions on hunting these animals are often not followed.
1.10.1. Pro: Almost [40 percent](https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-in-entertainment/cruel-sports/hunting/) of hunters in the U.S. slaughter and maim millions of animals on public land every year. By some estimates, poachers kill just as many animals illegally.
1.10.1.1. Pro: Most [federal and state agencies](https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-in-entertainment/cruel-sports/hunting/) that are charged with managing wildlife refuges, national forests, state parks, and other public lands are funded in part by hunting and fishing activities, so agency personnel often go out of their way to encourage these activities rather than regulate or police them.
1.10.2. Pro: Wildlife agencies also know that hunters are more likely to purchase licenses in subsequent years if a previous hunt resulted in a kill. Therefore, they implement programs—often called “wildlife management” or “conservation” programs—that are designed to boost the number of “game” species. These [programs](https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-in-entertainment/cruel-sports/hunting/) help to ensure that there are plenty of animals for hunters to kill and, consequently, plenty of revenue from the sale of hunting licenses.
1.10.3. Con: Better regulation enforcement can be put in place without the need to end trophy hunting.
1.10.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.
1.10.5. Con: This can be avoided by setting long-term tenures for hunting companies, creating an incentive to husband their own population of wildlife regardless of regulations. In Tanzania, companies with long-term leases harvested [fewer lions](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0162610&type=printable) than those with short-term leases, despite being under the same regulations.
1.10.6. Con: Implementing a system where government revenue comes from leasing land, rather than individual hunts, encourages enforcing regulations because there is no longer the [same incentive](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0162610&type=printable) to allow excessive hunting.
1.10.6.1. Con: Many countries do not have the governing or enforcement power to make sure regulations are followed properly.
1.10.6.1.1. Pro: In [Tanzania](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/10/trophy-hunting-killing-saving-animals/) there have been reports of foreign hunters gunning down animals, including pregnant females, with AK-47s. In a hunting area called Loliondo that the government has leased long term to officials from the United Arab Emirates, local Maasai have reported transport jets leaving with game of all variety, dead and alive.
1.10.6.1.2. Con: If the restrictions on hunting are already not being followed, then making it illegal is not assured to be followed. A better solution to this is reinforcing the legislation and improving the control over hunters.
1.10.6.1.2.1. Pro: If illegal it would be impossible to place restrictions on which animals could be hunted, thus trophy hunters could do even more harm.
1.10.6.1.2.1.1. Con: If trophy hunters care as much about conservation as they claim to, even when hunting illegally they will know which specific species to hunt.
1.10.6.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Criminalising trophy hunting would make it harder for trophy hunters to coordinate and determine safe levels of hunting. This would have a disparate impact on endangered species.
1.10.6.1.2.1.2. Pro: Because endangered and rare species often prized over others, if made illegal it is possible many hunters would take advantage of getting killing one these animals.
1.10.6.1.2.2. Pro: If trophy hunting was illegal rather than funding conservation the money would instead go towards criminal activity.
1.10.6.1.2.3. Con: As trophy hunters want to bring back their trophies they are actually very susceptible to regulations. This is why the US ban on elephant imports had such a [dramatic](http://www.newzimbabwe.com/news-21699-US+embargo+hits+Campfire+revenues/news.aspx) effect on the CAMPFIRE programme in Zimbabwe.
1.10.6.1.2.4. Con: The regulation of trophy hunting is usually managed by local governments. It would be possible for Western governments to make it illegal for their citizens to engage in trophy hunting overseas. This would create greater enforcement potential.
1.10.6.1.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.6.4.1.4.
1.10.7. Pro: -> See 1.10.6.1.
1.10.8. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.11.4.2.
1.10.9. Pro: [Trophy hunting](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/10/trophy-hunting-killing-saving-animals/) has burgeoned into a billion-dollar, profit-driven industry, overseen in some cases by corrupt governments.
1.10.9.1. Pro: According to [Transparency International](http://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/eij/article/hunting_is_a_setback_to_wildlife_conservation/), Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Tanzania are three of the most corrupt countries in the world, and money from trophy-hunters fuels this corruption.
1.10.9.2. Pro: The Namibian government has used elephant hunting permits [as leverage](https://africageographic.com/blog/trading-the-lives-of-desert-elephants-for-votes/) to gain political votes from rural communities.
1.10.9.2.1. Con: There have been [numerous claims](https://africacheck.org/factsheets/factsheet-namibia-votes/) of vote buying in Namibia. There is nothing specific to trophy hunting that makes vote buying more likely.
1.10.9.2.2. Pro: This is particularly dangerous as political short-term incentives \(i.e. vote buying\) could push these fragile populations to extinction.
1.10.9.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.
1.10.9.4. Con: A [US report](http://democrats-naturalresources.house.gov/imo/media/doc/Missing%20the%20Mark.pdf) found that trophy hunting is sometimes corrupt and sometimes not, thus, while avoiding some programs might be, an overall ban isn't justified for reasons of corruption.
1.10.9.5. Con: There are no structural reasons why trophy hunting would be more corrupt than any other comparable economic activity \(e.g. tourism\) within a particular country.
1.10.9.6. Con: Systems have been established in places like [Zimbabwe](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/11/24/opinions/trophy-hunting-decline-of-species-opinion-dickman/index.html) to regulate hunting, and while they will never be perfect, they are working relatively well.
1.10.9.7. Pro: In Tanzania a [majority](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0162610&type=printable) of the revenue from the Government run hunting areas comes from the individual hunts themselves \(rather than from leasing the land\). This means there is an incentive, in times of economic strife, to allow excessive hunting.
1.10.9.8. Con: -> See 1.10.6.
1.10.9.9. Pro: [Critics](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/10/trophy-hunting-killing-saving-animals/) say that no country should be in the business of selling and profiting from dead animals. When coffers run low and funds are needed, they say, hunting quotas get raised without regard for the animals’ population numbers.
1.10.9.9.1. Pro: That could explain how [40%](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/10/trophy-hunting-killing-saving-animals/) of Tanzania’s designated hunting areas have been emptied of game animals during recent decades.
1.10.9.10. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.2.2.
1.10.9.11. Pro: A promotional video that surfaced in 2014 shows a hunting company, Green Mile Safari, guiding hunters from the United Arab Emirates on a disturbing shooting party. The party violated a host of laws by, among other things, firing automatic weapons, hunting female and young animals, and allowing a minor to hunt. [The Tanzanian government](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/10/trophy-hunting-killing-saving-animals/) banned Green Mile from conducting hunts in 2014 but reissued the company’s license, leading to accusations of corruption.
1.10.10. Pro: Eschewing the time and cost of an [African trophy hunt](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/10/trophy-hunting-killing-saving-animals/) involving fair chase, some hunters have turned to canned hunting—the killing of often habituated animals in confined areas—baited hunting, herding animals with helicopters, or the shooting of their prey from the back of Land Cruisers.
1.10.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.10.11. Con: -> See 1.10.6.1.2.
1.11. Con: Trophy hunting can decrease [human-wildlife conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93wildlife_conflict).
1.11.1. Con: [Studies](https://www.thoughtco.com/is-hunting-ever-defensible-127868) show that car/deer collisions increase during hunting season because hunters frighten the deer out of the woods and onto roads.
1.11.2. Con: [Human/wildlife conflicts](https://www.thoughtco.com/is-hunting-ever-defensible-127868) are not the fault of wildlife, but are the fault of humans who take habitat from the wildlife.
1.11.2.1. Con: Humans are often forced to live in places which wildlife traditionally occupied due to economic pressures. As such they have few options to avoid conflict with wildlife.
1.11.2.1.1. Con: The fact that human-wildlife conflict happens because of other reasons such as concerns for living space does not mean that other causes of said conflict should not be catered to.
1.11.2.1.2. Con: It is due to [uncontrolled human populations](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/destruction-of-wildlife-habitat-is-causing-human-animal-conflict/), not economic pressure, that habitats have been destroyed, forcing animals to interact with humans. Humans treat wildlife as a nuisance when it is humans that have taken over their territory.
1.11.3. Pro: [Human wildlife conflict](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/christopher-clark/beneath-the-surface-of-th_b_8213258.html) - along with poaching and habitat encroachment - is generally considered to be a far bigger wildlife killer than controlled hunting.
1.11.3.1. Con: While it may be true that human-wildlife conflict, among other threats, may be a greater existential risk to wildlife, this not a reason not to also tackle trophy hunting.
1.11.3.2. Pro: Trophy hunting can be used to mitigate some of the ecosystem level threats. [For example](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/F4154206034F2CC49C89CD15282E0506/S0030605316000193a.pdf/investigating_the_potential_impact_of_trophy_hunting_of_wild_ungulates_on_snow_leopard_panthera_uncia_conservation_in_tajikistan.pdf) in Tajikistan trophy hunting of the prey species of the snow leopard seems to be having a positive effect on the snow leopard population.
1.11.4. Pro: In 2016, lions[killed](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/science/elephants-lions-africa-hunting.html) 4 people and 220 cows in Mozambique.
1.11.4.1. Con: -> See 1.8.
1.11.4.2. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.3.3.3.2.3.
1.11.5. Pro: Many rural farmers [need](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/science/elephants-lions-africa-hunting.html) additional agricultural land. Without an incentive to preserve the land or the animals which live on it, they have little reason to not kill the animals and let their cattle use the land.
1.11.5.1. Con: -> See 1.7.9.
1.11.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.
1.11.6. Con: Unless trophy hunting decreases the population of an animal in a certain region it cannot decrease human-wildlife interactions. The only way trophy hunting aids conflict is through the extermination of animals.
1.11.6.1. Con: Human-wildlife conflict is not always about a population surplus. There are many factors such as habitat destruction that can contribute to humans and animals coming more in contact.
1.11.7. Con: Some [traditional killing](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/11/24/opinions/trophy-hunting-decline-of-species-opinion-dickman/index.html) of lions still occurs, where young men spear them to gain wealth and status.
1.11.7.1. Con: While this may have different motivations and different consequences this is just an example of trophy hunting.
1.11.7.1.1. Pro: For example the Maasai people \(Kenya\), who would traditionally hunt lions as a right of passage, have made their own moves to change this practice with the [Maasai Olympics](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kenya-maasai/kenyas-maasai-break-with-coming-of-age-tradition-to-save-the-lion-idUSKBN1400X3). Trophy hunters should do the same to reform a practice which is far less culturally central.
1.11.7.2. Con: If this is an essential tradition to a group of people then trophy hunting could threaten this tradition.
1.11.8. Con: -> See 1.2.9.
1.11.9. Con: Trophy hunting still puts guides and hunters in the line of danger when hunting dangerous trophy species. As in the case of [Theunis Botha](https://nypost.com/2017/05/22/big-game-hunter-killed-when-shot-elephant-collapses-on-top-of-him/).
1.11.10. Pro: Animal populations have to be controlled to prevent over-grazing and overstocking of shared land between humans and the wild. Trophy hunting is an option to help maintain a balanced population.
1.11.10.1. Con: There are other viable alternatives to controlling wildlife populations, such as [immunocontraception.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunocontraception)
1.11.10.1.1. Pro: Some [studies](https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-in-entertainment/cruel-sports/hunting/) suggest that sterilization is an effective, long-term solution to overpopulation. A method called “trap, neuter, and return” has been tried on deer in Ithaca, New York, and an experimental birth-control vaccine is being used on female deer in Princeton, New Jersey.
1.11.10.1.1.1. Pro: One [Georgia study](https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-in-entertainment/cruel-sports/hunting/) of 1,500 white-tailed deer on Cumberland Island concluded that “if females are captured, marked, and counted, sterilization reduces herd size, even at relatively low annual sterilization rates.”
1.11.10.1.2. Pro: From 2006 to 2010, there was a [60% reduction](http://www.hsi.org/assets/pdfs/elephant_immuno_report_2012.pdf) in overall population growth of elephants treated with the porzine zona pellucida \(pZP\) vaccine on the Makalali Conservancy \(p.15\)
1.11.10.1.3. Pro: Using the pZP vaccine on a small portion of [wild-roaming elephants](http://www.hsi.org/issues/immunocontraception/facts/immunocontraception_elephants.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/) in the Makalai Private Game Reserve, researchers found a 0% population growth since 2008.
