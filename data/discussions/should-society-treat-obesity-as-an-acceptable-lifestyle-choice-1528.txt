Discussion Title: Should Society Treat Obesity as an Acceptable Lifestyle Choice?

1. Society should not treat obesity as an acceptable lifestyle choice.
1.1. Con: For many people, obesity is not a choice.
1.1.1. Pro: Society should not treat obesity as a lifestyle choice at all. While lifestyle is a small contributing factor to obesity, obesity itself isn’t always a choice.
1.1.2. Con: Corporations profit from highly addictive and unhealthy foods. People may not have much control over their weight therefore anger should be directed at the industries that play  a major role.
1.1.3. Con: Medically speaking, obesity is almost always the result of one's poor personal choices. Even if you have a metabolic disorder, obesity is usually the result of excessive carbohydrate intake. For the extreme few that have no control over it, they are the exception, not the rule. There is no reason to normalize a medical abnormality that is as harmful as obesity.
1.1.4. Con: Things like drug addiction are also linked to genetic makeup, however this is something that should be watched for and prevented rather than accepted.
1.1.5. Pro: Obesity is a symptom that has a range of possible causes. One is a lifestyle choice. Others include eating disorders \(i.e. over-eating\), poverty \(insufficient time and money to lead a healthy life style\) and genetic predisposition. Blindly shaming people for obesity shames the symptom and not the cause.
1.1.6. Con: Obesity is either a choice or a disease. If it is a choice, that should be unacceptable. If it is not, then it is a disease and should be treated before it causes complications. Either way, staying obese should be unacceptable.
1.1.7. Pro: Whilst there are a number of individuals who have certain diseases which can influence their weight, the problem lies with the food industry manufacturing obesity and then putting the responsibility on the individual to lo[ose that weight by following unscientific diets and bu](https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&lr=&id=39oVBbtt6IEC&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=food+industry+manufacturing+obesity&ots=2Y-Gc1UAQz&sig=FBeYyHZp0O-kUmBaZkMVOw8cISM#v=onepage&q&f=false)ying "low Fat" foods. These "low fat" foods are often owned by the same companies selling unhealthy food and don't tackle the cause. Although the individual is always responsible, the food industry is perhaps more so.
1.1.8. Con: According to the [laws of thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_thermodynamics), it is literally impossible to become obese if one's food intake is controlled. The body cannot create fat from nothing.
1.1.9. Con: A society that unquestioningly accepts obesity is one that will continue to fail to provide mechanisms to address many of the factors that cause it \(e.g. food shortages and lack of education\).
1.1.9.1. Con: Society is not in any danger of 'unquestioningly' accepting obesity, and few are even asking for unquestioning acceptance. Most body positive groups would settle for obesity being seen as something that does not diminish human worth.
1.1.10. Con: The fact that some people do not choose obesity doesn't mean we should accept those who do, and society is capable of distinguishing between those two groups.
1.1.10.1. Con: Society thus far has been unable or unwilling to distinguish between those two groups in a majority of cases.
1.1.10.2. Con: Whether or not someone has 'chosen' to be obese is often not clear-cut, and when in doubt, society tends to condemn and shame.
1.1.10.3. Pro: For example, we are able to recognise that some people are on welfare out of necessity, but consider it unacceptable for people to choose that as a lifestyle if they are able to find gainful employment.
1.1.10.3.1. Con: Society does a poor job distinguishing these groups, and frequently shames those dependent on welfare out of no fault of their own.
1.1.10.4. Pro: Those who choose to be obese divert resources and support away from those who are genuinely victims of circumstance.
1.1.10.5. Con: Society cannot differentiate those who are obese by choice from those who aren't because both look alike.
1.1.10.6. Con: This is a hard nuance to ensure society follows. Once body-shaming of obese people is normalised by this approach, it is difficult to ensure that individual members of society assess the reasons for someone's obesity or carefully consider their exact message before treating it as an unacceptable lifestyle choice.
1.1.11. Con: In these instances, we would not consider the individuals unacceptable, but rather the structural or policy failures which have robbed them of their bodily autonomy.
1.1.11.1. Con: -> See 1.1.10.6.
1.1.11.2. Pro: This is already true, for example, in how society views obese children, not as deviants but rather as victims of unacceptable circumstance.
1.1.12. Pro: It is discriminatory to shame people for an involuntary characteristic.
1.1.12.1. Con: Obesity is not an involuntary characteristic for the vast majority of the obese population. Eating less is almost alway possible and it is almost always more healthy to be at a lower weight than be obese.
1.1.12.2. Pro: This makes fat shaming directly analogous to other forms of discrimination, like racism and sexism.
1.1.12.2.1. Con: You can *choose* whether to be overweight or not. You cannot choose your race, gender, or sexual preference. The key difference between shame and discrimination is the recipient's ability to affect the trait through choice.
1.1.12.2.2. Pro: Prejudices against obese people [operate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8014833) in a similar way to racism.
1.1.12.3. Con: Though obesity is involuntary, it is also [preventable](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1790820/), in a way that other immutable characteristics are not.
1.1.12.3.1. Con: Obesity may be preventable, but it is often incurable. [Long-term weight-loss maintenance: a meta-analysis of US studies](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/74/5/579.full)
1.1.12.4. Con: If we see obesity as an involuntary condition we do a disservice to the obese because that portrays them as powerless victims of an inevitable outcome rather than as individuals with the power to change their lives.
1.1.13. Con: Even if obesity isn't a choice in some circumstances, society should still shame it in general because it creates a narrative that empowers people to make healthy choices rather than see themselves as powerless victims.
1.1.13.1. Con: The narrative of 'you can choose not to be obese' is much, much more hurtful to the obese than it is helpful.
1.1.14. Pro: Being shamed by society for something you cannot control can be deeply damaging to a person's mental health.
1.1.14.1. Con: Telling people that their weight is outside of their control will stop them from trying to control it. If your weight is indeed outside of your control, you should seek medical help. Either way, people should be encouraged to lose weight.
1.1.14.2. Con: Shaming does not inherently mean that the person being shamed is a bad person or deserves to be discriminated against.
1.1.14.2.1. Con: The intent behind the shaming does not particularly matter to the person being shamed. Depending upon their own experiences and self-perception, they may internalize the shame to mean they are a bad person.
1.1.14.2.2. Con: Even if not all shaming carries negative or discriminatory meaning, plenty does. It is difficult for individuals to distinguish between shaming that comes from a place of concern as opposed to repulsion.
1.1.14.2.3. Pro: Society is capable of disapproving of something without directly bullying people.
1.1.14.2.3.1. Pro: By encouraging healthy behaviors through positive advertisement and public example, society can send the message that obesity is not acceptable without bullying.
1.1.14.2.3.1.1. Con: Obesity is already shamed, and further discouragement is likely to make shaming more prevalent.
1.1.14.2.3.1.2. Pro: [TheTruth.com](https://www.thetruth.com/the-facts) is an anti-smoking campaign that has helped lower the smoking rate among teens from 9% to 7% in a few years through facts and exposing big tobacco companies, not shaming.
1.1.14.2.3.1.3. Pro: The ['Let's Move!' initiative](http://www.letsmove.gov/) started by First Lady Michelle Obama is an example that focuses on transforming the way children interact and think about food and exercise.
1.1.14.2.3.1.4. Con: It is not necessarily easy to monitor how societal disapproval is acted upon. While those policy changes may be made, encouraging disapproval of obese people is likely to increase unkind behaviour towards those individuals.
1.1.14.2.3.2. Con: Being perceived as overweight is already one of the [major](http://bullyonline.org/old/related/overweig.htm) reasons children and adults get bullied, and it often makes no difference if the bullied person loses weight.
1.1.14.2.3.2.1. Pro: People often choose the most direct way of enforcing conformity, so it's unlikely that bullying of overweight people would stop.
1.1.14.2.3.2.2. Pro: [Children](http://www.obesityaction.org/educational-resources/resource-articles-2/childhood-obesity-resource-articles/bullying-bullycide-and-childhood-obesity) are often the most at risk for 'fat bullying'. Of overweight 6th graders, 24% of boys and 30% of girls were teased, bullied, or rejected on a daily basis because of their weight. The figures double for high-school students.
1.1.14.2.3.3. Pro: There is a difference between individual mocking/bullying, and societal disapproval. Societal disapproval looks like banning large sodas or incentivizing healthy habits, and does not directly target an individual.
1.1.14.2.3.3.1. Pro: Similar to "hate the sin, not the sinner," not accepting obesity does not necessary equal a perception of obese people as inferior but can happen for other reasons, for example genuine medical concern.
1.1.14.2.3.3.1.1. Pro: The US Department of Health considers obesity to be at ["unacceptable levels"](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/hus08.pdf) \(p. 4\), chiefly because of its contribution to various diseases that haunt the American people, not because it considers obese citizens inferior.
1.1.14.2.3.3.1.2. Con: Obese people [face stigma in all areas of life](http://www.obesityaction.org/weight-bias-and-stigma/understanding-obesity-stigma-brochure). So while some people might be genuinely concerned for somebody's health, the vast majority of obese people are regularly confronted with prejudice, hateful behavior, and systemic disadvantages based on the perception of obese people as inferior.
1.1.14.2.3.3.1.3. Con: There is evidence that suggests that the prevalence of weight [discrimination](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18317471) in the US is similar to those facing gender or race discrimination.
1.1.14.2.3.3.2. Pro: Societal disapproval focused on health and not weight may be a better way to encourage weight loss and healthier habits.
1.1.14.2.3.3.2.1. Con: Societal disapproval of obesity specifically calls for a focus on weight, and therefore does not fit within efforts to focus on health rather than weight as a way of encouraging healthy habits and lifestyle choices.
1.1.14.2.3.3.2.2. Pro: [The Association for Size Diversity and Health](https://www.sizediversityandhealth.org/index.asp) promotes education, research, and services focused on health and well-being free from weight discrimination and weight-based assumptions as a way to combat obesity.
1.1.14.2.3.3.3. Pro: A '[fat tax'](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Wellness/fat-tax-lower-obesity/story?id=16353067) has been proposed as a way to decrease obesity by increasing the amount taxed on unhealthy foods. Doing so may decrease the negative externalities of obesity.
1.1.14.2.3.3.3.1. Con: The recent tax on large drinks shows the helplessness of a government to act against in individuals self-interest.  People just bought many smaller sized drinks or went to another state to drink what they wanted.  People will do what they want to do regardless of what a nanny state dictates.  Underground activities occur.
1.1.14.2.3.3.3.2. Con: The effectiveness of a taxation policy to curb obesity is [doubtful.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3810203/)
1.1.14.2.3.3.3.2.1. Con: 'Fat taxes' do [reduce consumption](http://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/news/fat-taxes-do-work-eu-report-finds/) of the taxed products.
1.1.14.2.3.3.3.2.2. Con: High junk food taxes \(≥ 20%\) may lead to [measurable decreases in obesity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3828689/), particularly if combined with additional interventions such as healthy food subsidies, or health education.
1.1.14.2.3.3.3.3. Con: For some, fat taxes may increase obesity, as they may reduce not just the consumption of junk food, but also the [time devoted to physical activity](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272709000127).
1.1.14.2.3.3.3.4. Pro: A [soda tax](http://www.wsj.com/articles/soda-taxes-approved-in-four-cities-vote-looms-in-chicagos-cook-county-1478698979) was recently approved in 4 US cities as a way to encourage healthier beverage choices.
1.1.14.2.3.3.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.14.2.3.3.3.2.1.
1.1.14.2.3.3.3.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.14.2.3.3.3.2.2.
1.1.14.2.3.3.4. Con: Societal disapproval can indirectly encourage bullying of overweight and obese populations, thus contributing to the problem.
1.1.14.2.3.3.5. Con: -> See 1.1.14.2.3.1.4.
1.1.14.2.3.4. Con: -> See 1.1.10.6.
1.1.14.2.4. Con: Making it socially unacceptable to be obese will [increase bullying](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/fat-stigma-fuels-weight-bullying/?_r=0) of obese people.
1.1.14.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.14.2.3.
1.1.14.2.4.2. Con: This discouragement doesn't have to take the form of shaming individuals, but can rather be framed as a collective problem in which everyone has a stake.
1.1.14.2.4.2.1. Con: This discouragement has and will likely continue to take the form of shaming individuals.
1.1.14.2.4.2.2. Pro: This is the approach that governments have used for other public health concerns, such as [binge drinking](https://drinkwise.org.au/our-work/parents-campaign/#).
1.1.14.2.4.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.10.6.
1.1.14.2.4.3. Pro: Now bullies will be able to conceal their malicious intent under the veil of genuine concern for someone's wellbeing.
1.1.14.2.5. Con: When it comes to judgement, people constantly fail to distinguish the person from his/her behavior.
1.1.14.2.5.1. Pro: Obesity is perceived as the effect of bad lifestyle decisions or weak power of will. These traits being associated with obesity build bias against obese people.
1.1.14.2.6. Con: Shame is [by definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shame) a painful social emotion. Trying to cause that is a form of discrimination.
1.1.14.3. Pro: Hate crimes attack an individual's unchangeable characteristics and cause long lasting feelings of helplessness and powerlessness \([Dzelme, p. 22](http://cilvektiesibas.org.lv/site/attachments/30/01/2012/Naida_noziegums_ENG_cietusajiem_Internetam.pdf)\). Obese people are likely to feel the same way.
1.1.15. Pro: One's social environment causes obesity and often cannot be influenced.
1.1.15.1. Con: One's diet causes or does not cause obesity, a social environment is an influencing factor but ultimately has no direct relationship.
1.1.15.2. Pro: Research suggests that there are [links between low incomes and obesity](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/mar/16/poorer-children-obese-decade-ago), with people who are poorer becoming obese as a result of being unable to afford healthy food options.
1.1.15.2.1. Pro: 23.5 million people in the United States live in '[food deserts](https://www.dosomething.org/facts/11-facts-about-food-deserts),' where they have minimal to no access to affordable, healthy food. This means that their only options for food are cheap, processed foods or fast food like McDonald's.
1.1.15.2.1.1. Con: It is still possible to not be obese while consuming fast food by simply eating less of it.
1.1.15.2.1.1.1. Con: It is also possible to not be obese and eat lots of fast food. The factors that control weight are a lot more complicated than most would have you believe.
1.1.15.2.1.2. Pro: Healthy, natural foods are often significantly more expensive than cheap, processed foods.
1.1.15.2.1.2.1. Pro: An [analysis](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/healthy-vs-unhealthy-diet-costs-1-50-more/) of various studies conducted in high-income countries concluded that a healthy diet is on average about 1.50$ more expensive per day than an unhealthy diet. This equals an extra cost of about 550$ per person per year.
1.1.15.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: The cheapest healthy options tend to require preparation time, which the chronically poor and disadvantaged may not be able to realistically spare from work and family care.
1.1.15.2.1.3. Pro: Because of the easy and affordable access to fast food in comparison to healthy grocery markets, food deserts have [higher rates of obesity](http://www.foodispower.org/food-deserts/) than other areas.
1.1.15.2.1.4. Pro: In many fast food restaurants, the [healthier options](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2016/01/05/the-myth-of-healthy-fast-food-one-chains-salad-has-more-fat-than-a-big-mac/) \(e.g. a salad or smoothie\) contain the same amount or more empty calories than the unhealthy options \(e.g.hamburgers and french fries\). This makes the task of making healthier choices that much harder when you have limited options.
1.1.15.2.1.5. Con: Shaming could lead to, for example, more exercise or healthier choices \(e.g. a salad over a hamburger\), options that still exist in food deserts.
1.1.15.2.1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.15.2.1.4.
1.1.15.2.1.6. Con: Widespread societal agreement about obesity's unacceptability can help support policy changes that may prevent obesity, like scheduling more time for physical education in schools or taxing sugary drinks.
1.1.15.2.1.6.1. Con: We had widespread societal agreement that obesity is disgusting and unacceptable for a long time; the Fat Acceptance Movement's challenge to this norm is very recent. Obesity did not disappear and programs to fight it did not appear because of that widespread shaming.
1.1.15.2.1.6.2. Con: Poor nutrition and lack of exercise lead to a large spectrum of diseases. Targeting obesity is unnecessary when governments should implement these kind of policies for the overall wellbeing of their citizens.
1.1.15.2.1.6.3. Con: There's already widespread agreement about the undesirability of an obese population. 

It's unclear what benefit personally criticising specific individuals would add.
1.1.15.2.1.6.4. Con: Society-wide shaming is one path to getting these policies, but there are also other less destructive ones.
1.1.15.2.1.6.4.1. Pro: Widespread effective [behavioral weight loss programs](http://doctorsofweightloss.com/improved-body-image-leads-to-better-weight-loss-results-4166) foster an atmosphere that regards obesity as an urgent problem. This can induce policy initiatives to do the same.
1.1.15.2.1.6.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.14.2.3.1.3.
1.1.15.2.1.6.4.3. Pro: Obesity related NGOs, such as the [World Obesity Federation](http://www.worldobesity.org/who-we-are/governance/policy/), already places pressure for policy change.
1.1.15.2.1.6.5. Pro: Policies such as [Weight of the Nation](http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/downloads/early-care-and-education-policy-review-final_web508.pdf): Early Care and Education intend to educate childcare providers, decision-makers, and public health professionals on ways to prevent and take action on childhood obesity.
1.1.15.2.1.6.6. Pro: Many people who are currently obese would prefer not to be, but lack the resources and support to lose weight. This suggests they recognise their condition as detrimental to their wellbeing.
1.1.15.2.1.6.6.1. Con: A [significant](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-obese-people-idUSTRE69C5TY20101013) number of obese people consider their weight as just right.
1.1.15.2.1.6.7. Pro: Public health policies, such as those listed above, benefit not only the obese but society as a whole.
1.1.15.2.1.6.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.14.2.3.3.3.
1.1.15.2.1.6.9. Con: Even if preventing childhood obesity is a justified goal, the societal condemnation of adults' obesity is not necessary.
1.1.15.2.1.6.9.1. Pro: Children do not have full control over their diet and physical activity, so they should be protected, while adults should have total freedom to decide for themselves.
1.1.15.2.1.6.9.2. Con: Targeting adults to achieve policy change is necessary because they are the voters.
1.1.15.2.1.6.10. Con: Physical activity does little to promote health. Diet is the far more important variable.
1.1.15.2.1.7. Pro: Being born to certain racial minorities increases the likelihood of obesity.
1.1.15.2.1.7.1. Pro: This means that the shame and stigma that society would attach through this approach would compound additional disadvantages and exclusions suffered by these individuals.
1.1.15.2.1.7.2. Pro: Many [unhealthy food advertisements](http://today.uconn.edu/2015/08/unhealthy-food-advertising-targets-black-and-hispanic-youth/) are targeted towards low-income minority groups, especially Black and Hispanic American youth, making it less likely for them to choose healthier food options.
1.1.15.2.2. Con: Rich people are more likely to be obese.
1.1.15.2.2.1. Pro: [Men in more prestigious positions](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19039314) such as management/supervisory roles were heavier in size and BMI. Those with more 'socially acceptable' BMIs hold 'lower class' positions \(e.g. sales\).
1.1.15.2.2.2. Pro: In many developing countries, [obesity is positively correlated with socio-economic status](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3798095/), because the ability to overeat is something most of the population cannot access.
1.1.15.2.2.3. Con: This is not true in the USA, where obesity correlates with [low socioeconomic status](http://stateofobesity.org/socioeconomics-obesity/).
1.1.15.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.15.2.1.
1.1.15.4. Pro: Childhood experiences beyond one's control lead to obesity.
1.1.15.4.1. Con: Poor diet leads to obesity, childhood experiences are an influencing factor but diet is ultimately a separate matter, as a result insofar as there is access to nutritious food, the individual remains responsible.
1.1.15.4.2. Pro: [Research](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/12/sexual-abuse-victims-obesity/420186/) has shown that childhood sexual abuse often causes food-related disorders, and thus obesity.
1.1.15.4.3. Pro: Children have a very limited capacity to prevent obesity.
1.1.15.4.3.1. Pro: Lack of access to [recreational facilities and parks](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23364027) is linked to increased prevalence of obesity.
1.1.15.4.3.2. Pro: Studies [indicate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15238901) that the children of overweight parents tend to be overweight themselves - and that obese children are [much more likely](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8483856) to be obese as adults than children with normal weight.
1.1.15.4.3.3. Pro: For example, children often lack the capacity to control their own diet and/or exercise.
1.1.15.4.3.4. Pro: Food industry [advertisements directed at young children](http://www.apa.org/topics/kids-media/food.aspx) have been linked with increased obesity.
1.1.15.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.15.4.3.1.
1.1.15.6. Con: In social environments that cause obesity, there are a lot of non-obese people living in those areas too. This illustrates that the environment might be influential but the individual nevertheless retains a choice.
1.1.16. Pro: Illnesses and physical problems are a cause of obesity.
1.1.16.1. Pro: [Mental illness](http://www.obesitynetwork.ca/Obesity-and-Mental-Illness-Addressing-a-Double-Epidemic-322) can be a cause of obesity, one many public health professionals overlook.
1.1.16.1.1. Pro: Many antidepressant drugs have [weight gain as a side-effect](http://www.webmd.com/depression/features/antidepressants-weight-gain).
1.1.16.1.2. Con: Not all people with mental illnesses are obese. This illustrates that there remains a personal choice even for them.
1.1.16.1.2.1. Con: The fact that not all mentally ill people are obese does not change the fact that some mental illnesses may relate to overeating or poor eating choices by individuals that lead to obesity.
1.1.16.1.2.1.1. Pro: Those with depression have a 58% chance of becoming obese, more than the average. \([NOO](http://www.noo.org.uk/uploads/doc/vid_10266_Obesity%20and%20mental%20health_FINAL_070311_MG.pdf), p. 4\)
1.1.16.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.16.1.1.
1.1.16.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.16.1.2.1.1.
1.1.16.2. Pro: Physical disabilities can prevent people from exercising.
1.1.16.2.1. Con: Physical disabilities might prevent people from exercising but do not oblige them to eat more.
1.1.16.2.2. Con: There are thin people with physical disabilities.
1.1.16.3. Pro: [Thyroid](http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=56872) problems can cause a slow metabolism and thus prevent losing weight.
1.1.16.4. Con: Medical conditions can make it difficult to lose weight, but the overwhelming majority of conditions do not undermine the basis of weight gain \(calorie intake versus calorie burning\). Underlying conditions may make it difficult to lose weight, but not impossible.
1.1.16.4.1. Con: If it is particularly difficult for some people to lose weight, it seems unfair to burden them with having to go to that extreme effort in order to relieve themselves of societal shame.
1.1.16.5. Pro: [Medication](https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/adult/causes.html) increases the risk of obesity.
1.1.16.6. Con: In the US in1950, the obesity rate stood at 10% but [rose](http://www.livestrong.com/article/384722-how-much-have-obesity-rates-risen-since-1950/) to 35% in 2010. This illustrates that for the majority of obese people it is a choice, as people back then had the same physical characteristics as people today.
1.1.16.6.1. Pro: The genetic makeup of humans did not change much between 1950 and 2010.
1.1.16.6.2. Pro: The rate of obesity caused by physical disabilities was most likely higher in 1950s because there were war invalids and medical technology was less enabling for people with disabilities.
1.1.17. Pro: People suffer from obesity because of their genetic makeup.
1.1.17.1. Con: A ketogenic diet is the cure to obesity. It is not possible to maintain obesity when your body is in fat burning mode.
1.1.17.1.1. Con: Physics does not change just because you are getting the majority or you calories from fat.  If you still eat 500 Cal more than you burn each day, you will gain a pound of fat a week.
1.1.17.1.1.1. Con: It is true that calories matter but it is easier to keep a lower calorie diet on a ketogenic diet.
1.1.17.2. Con: [A study](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/obesity-prevention-source/obesity-causes/genes-and-obesity/) has shown that heredity is not destiny.  It also claims eating a healthy diet and sufficient exercise can counteract the effects of the genetic abmormalities.
1.1.17.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.16.3.
1.1.17.4. Pro: Obesity is an occurrence that runs in [families](https://public.health.oregon.gov/DiseasesConditions/GeneticConditions/Documents/ArticleBend.pdf). It is estimated that 60% is caused by genetic similarities and only 40% by lifestyle similarities.
1.1.17.4.1. Pro: [Twins](https://public.health.oregon.gov/DiseasesConditions/GeneticConditions/Documents/ArticleBend.pdf) raised in different families shared a tendency to become obese.
1.1.17.5. Pro: There are a [dozen](https://public.health.oregon.gov/DiseasesConditions/GeneticConditions/Documents/ArticleBend.pdf) genetic variations that increase one's chances of obesity.
1.1.17.6. Con: -> See 1.1.16.6.
1.1.18. Con: Eating less is a choice everyone can make.
1.1.18.1. Pro: It may be harder to lose weight for some people with a specific diagnosis, but there is no common condition where it is not possible to lose weight, and there is no situation where being obese is healthier than being inside normal weight ranges.
1.1.18.2. Con: Eating disorders are not a choice.
1.1.18.3. Con: Many people have addictions to processed foods and no knowledge to break them. [The Pleasure Trap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dtf9-4KNKkE)
1.1.18.4. Con: This is a common myth known as 'a calorie is a calorie'. This myth was created and propagated by the sugar industry to make it seem like sugar was a healthy food. Don't repeat such falsehoods, as they have given us obesity in the first place. [Why “Calories in, Calories Out” Doesn't Tell The Whole Story](http://www.healthline.com/nutrition/debunking-the-calorie-myth)
1.1.18.4.1. Con: A nutrition professor tested the "a calorie is a calorie" idea by eating predominantly junk food for two months. He carefully ensured he burned more calories than he consumed, and [lost 27 pounds](http://edition.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/11/08/twinkie.diet.professor/index.html).
1.1.19. Con: Most common reasons for Obesity are unbalanced eating and not active lifestyle. Where active does not necessarily mean sports.
1.1.20. Con: The rise of health information on the internet presents health opportunities like never before.
1.1.20.1. Con: Having health information available doesn't always empower you to actually use it. Eating disorders, for example, aren't usually fixed by reading.
1.1.21. Pro: -> See 1.1.18.3.
1.1.22. Pro: Obesity may be influenced by use of antibiotics in early life, an addiction to sugar due to clever marketing, and a sedentary lifestyle due to cars and office based employment.
1.1.23. Con: The foods one eats is always a choice. Obesity is treatable by changing the diet to remove lipogenic food sources such as insulin secreting foods like white flour, sugar, grains, and other carbohydrates that are common in Western diets.
1.1.23.1. Con: Changing one's diet is not always feasible because of the constraints of budget.
1.2. Con: Gluttony is the issue with which society should take exception. Indulging beyond the needs of nutrition can occur in all people, and would require more personal honesty and humility. Obesity is an outward appearance may be the result of a situation warranting compassion and kindness, not ridicule and shame.
1.2.1. Pro: Gluttony – not laziness – might be responsible for the obesity epidemic, according to research showing that we’re doing just as much physical activity as we were in the early 1980s. [International Journal of Obesity \(2008\)](http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v32/n8/full/ijo200874a.html)
1.3. Pro: Accepting or even celebrating an unhealthy physical condition is indicative of the toxic effect of intellectual and cultural relativism in contemporaneity western society.
1.4. Pro: The "body acceptance" or "fat acceptance" movement, while in itself a noble idea, has negative repercussions such as outright discouraging people from bettering their health conditions by losing weight.
1.5. Con: Being obese does not harm others.
1.5.1. Pro: [We should base our morality on the informed consent of affected parties.](https://www.kialo.com/good-and-evil-is-informed-consent-the-determining-factor-of-morality-21075/21075.0=21075.1/=21075.1/comments)
1.5.2. Con: Being obese as a parental figure or guardian sets a poor example for children, and childhood obesity is not only on the rise but could arguably be construed as child abuse \(children do not have the agency or means to make their own dietary choices\).
1.6. Con: It would be better for society if we deferred to personal autonomy, as people would be better able to self-actualize and be the people they want to be.
1.6.1. Pro: Intruding on personal choices, even if motivated by health concerns, is an unacceptable violation of individual autonomy. Forcing people to gain weight would be considered unethical, and so should the opposite.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Interfering with bodily integrity is oppressive towards people in different situations, whether they are perceived as "unnatural" \(such as obesity\) or "natural" \(such as [pregnancy](http://www.adiosbarbie.com/2016/07/3-ways-pregnant-people-face-body-oppression/)\).
1.6.1.2. Pro: In the United States, for example, the Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld rights that protect bodily integrity.
1.6.2. Pro: People should be allowed to value their life as they see fit. If they self-actualize best through obesity, we should not prevent them from doing so.
1.6.2.1. Con: Society generally sets limits on self-actualization once it hurts society.
1.6.2.1.1. Pro: People shouldn't be allowed to murder other people just because it allows them to acheive self-actualization.
1.6.3. Con: If people are obese due to circumstance rather than free choice, their autonomy is not being respected when we simply accept their condition.
1.6.4. Con: People may be more able to realize their dreams of losing weight if they are pressured to by the larger community.
1.6.4.1. Con: Being pressured by society to lose weight may persuade someone to take action in favor of society's desires, which may not be desires of their own.
1.6.4.1.1. Con: When society's values lead to healthier/better outcomes, this might be a good thing.
1.6.4.1.1.1. Con: Equating "health" with "thinness" is subjective: Studies have shown that there are [only a few health benefits](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/spc3.12076/abstract) to losing weight. Societal values often rely on stereotypes and disregard current research.
1.6.4.2. Pro: Being pressured into action may help obese individuals experience things that improve their quality of life \(e.g. increased mobility and better sleep\). This can motivate them to realize their dreams of losing weight and being healthier.
1.6.5. Con: The problems caused by obesity are tremendous, while interference in personal autonomy is minimal.
1.6.5.1. Con: This is false.
1.6.5.2. Pro: Obesity creates negative externalities that harm society.
1.6.5.2.1. Pro: In confined spaces, such as airplanes or small elevators, obese people create uncomfortable situations to other passengers.
1.6.5.2.2. Con: Many physical characteristics which exist on a spectrum from biologically determined to lifestyle choice--and research shows obesity to be closer to biologically determined--create social ills, or externalities. For example, CrossFit causes numerous injuries and need for surgery. [forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dandiamond/2015/05/11/is-crossfit-good-for-you-what-60-minutes-didnt-say/#455a4c0d508c)  Obesity cannot be separated from other aspects of free choice over one's corporeal existence.
1.6.5.2.3. Pro: In the context of global food shortages and environmental crises, society should be critical of excess consumption in all its forms.
1.6.5.2.3.1. Pro: The manufacturing of processed and packaged foods has [devastating environmental impacts](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/07/080723094838.htm).
1.6.5.2.3.1.1. Pro: [Rainforests and jungles are literally being clear-cut](http://www.naturalnews.com/038004_processed_food_rainforest_destruction.html#ixzz4Vq5XBrYj) and turned into mega-plantations to mass-produce food.
1.6.5.2.3.1.2. Pro: [An estimated 19 percent](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/07/080723094838.htm) of total energy \(mostly from non-renewable sources\) used in the USA is taken up in the production and supply of food.
1.6.5.2.3.1.3. Con: We do not need to criticize excess consumption in order to address food shortages and environmental crises.
1.6.5.2.3.1.3.1. Pro: One way to reduce the harm to the environment is to [promote reusable packaging](http://researchonline.ljmu.ac.uk/4468/) \(e.g. bottles, bags, food containers\).
1.6.5.2.3.1.3.2. Pro: Along with other supply chain and consumption changes, the return to traditional farming would [contribute significantly](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/07/080723094838.htm) to a decline in the energy consumption of the US food system - by as much as 50 percent.
1.6.5.2.3.2. Pro: Consumption of meat is linked to both [obesity](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/news/news86602.html) and [global warming](http://science.time.com/2013/12/16/the-triple-whopper-environmental-impact-of-global-meat-production/).
1.6.5.2.3.2.1. Pro: [Meat production requires a lot of processed food](http://\(http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/footprint/agriculture/soy/\)) \(like soya or corn\) to feed the livestock. The increased consumption of meat contributes to deforestation and excessive energy use as a side-effect of the increased production of the processed food.
1.6.5.2.3.3. Con: Critiquing obesity is an indirect and ineffective method of combating consumerist culture.
1.6.5.2.3.3.1. Con: Food production accounts for nearly [20%](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/07/080723094838.htm) of America's carbon emissions, and could be reduced by 50% by changing people's consumption patterns.
1.6.5.2.3.4. Con: Obesity induces companies to invest in [GMO](http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/pages/do-gm-crops-increase-yield.aspx) \(Genetically Modified Organisms\) research that can mitigate environmental threats.
1.6.5.2.3.4.1. Pro: Because obese people consume more, there will be a rise in demand for foodstuff products. To fulfill this demand, GMO research will be necessary.
1.6.5.2.3.4.1.1. Con: There is more food available than can be eaten. Obese people just eating more will not cause more research into GMOs.
1.6.5.2.3.4.2. Pro: Foodstuff companies profit off obesity-related consumption. This puts them in a financial position that allows for more investments in GMO research.
1.6.5.2.3.4.2.1. Con: The companies selling cheap, high-caloric, foods are not the same companies doing advanced biochemical and genetic research.
1.6.5.2.3.4.2.2. Con: Foodstuff companies that invest in GMO research like [ConAgra](https://www.statista.com/statistics/248271/net-sales-of-conagra-foods-worldwide/) have major sales figures already. Extra consumption by obese people is marginal to their R&D investment decisions.
1.6.5.2.3.4.3. Con: If companies do cater to the obese, it is at the expense of the rest of us.
1.6.5.2.3.5. Pro: For most people it is easier to make dietary changes - which could significantly impact health and the environment - than other more drastic lifestyle changes, like giving up one's car. Thus we should use our political capital where it is most likely to be effective.
1.6.5.2.3.5.1. Con: Most people will not follow this logic, because the impact of their personal choices is totally insignificant compared to other sources of pollution such as the industry.
1.6.5.2.3.5.2. Con: Often obesity isn't caused by excess consumption but rather poor choices between food options.
1.6.5.2.3.5.2.1. Con: If the result is to be found unacceptable, so is a poor choice of food options.
1.6.5.2.3.5.2.2. Pro: Poor food diets have high amounts of carbohydrates - which release insulin in the blood stream to deal with glucose, and thus cause insulin resistance over many years. The calories in - calories out model has been debunked as simply too simple, and macronutrients surely count. CICO is an excuse for obesity invented by sugar advocates to make it seem plausible. [Dr. Ted Naiman - Insulin Resistance at Low Carb Down Under](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd8QFD5Ht18)
1.6.5.2.3.6. Con: Food crises exist in places like Africa, not the United States. Food resources are not easily substitutable or transferrable.
1.6.5.2.3.6.1. Con: Often these crises are the direct result of smaller, poorer nations exporting their food supplies to the West \(e.g. the [quinoa boom](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/16/vegans-stomach-unpalatable-truth-quinoa) in the West caused a mini food crisis in Bolivia, where it is natively grown.\)
1.6.5.2.3.6.2. Pro: The cost of food transportation and distribution would be very high.
1.6.5.2.3.6.2.1. Con: The food trade is already a massive global industry, in which more than [one-fifth of calories grown on farms](http://environment.umn.edu/discovery/gli/unraveling-the-complex-web-of-global-food-trade/) are ultimately traded.
1.6.5.2.3.6.3. Pro: Food distribution would require additional administrative costs and efforts such as control over the fair allocation of goods.
1.6.5.2.3.6.3.1. Con: -> See 1.6.5.2.3.6.2.1.
1.6.5.2.3.6.4. Pro: A lot of food is easily perishable.
1.6.5.2.3.6.4.1. Con: Grains, dried or processed foods and anything that can be frozen or chilled can [easily be traded over vast distances and periods of time](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/26/business/worldbusiness/26food.html).
1.6.5.2.3.6.5. Pro: The [main causes of food shortages](http://www.harvesthelp.org.uk/causes-of-food-insecurity-in-african-and-other-third-world-countries.html) in Africa are harsh climate, lack of infrastructure, corruption and military conflicts. These will not be solved by American limits on consumption.
1.6.5.2.3.6.6. Con: These crises are heavily driven by the [move to cash crop production](http://www.alternet.org/story/152335/food_emergency%3A_how_the_world_bank_and_imf_have_made_african_famine_inevitable) to service debts, moving investment from sustenance crops to those that can be exported.
1.6.5.2.3.6.7. Con: -> See 1.6.5.2.3.6.2.1.
1.6.5.2.3.7. Con: -> See 1.6.5.2.3.5.2.
1.6.5.2.3.8. Con: -> See 1.6.5.2.3.1.3.
1.6.5.2.3.9. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.2.3.1.1.
1.6.5.2.3.10. Pro: Agribusiness is too large.
1.6.5.2.4. Pro: In economics terms, obesity has [negative externalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality#Negative). In other areas, for example environmental pollution, societies try to [internalize](http://www.env-econ.net/negative-externality.html) these negative externalities by imposing a price on their production.
1.6.5.2.4.1. Pro: For example, obese people impose a [negative externality](http://www.nber.org/papers/w11529) on other citizens by making health insurance more expensive. This extra cost could be "internalized" by imposing a premium on obese people.
1.6.5.2.5. Pro: Obesity [creates social contagion](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/26/health/26fat.html?_r=1&hp=&adxnnl=1&oref=slogin&pagewanted=all&adxnnlx=1185466586-LEV96P2vfwYs+0EqoNTxgA) and increases the likelihood of people in the social network of obese people becoming obese themselves.
1.6.5.2.6. Pro: Obesity does economic harm and thus damages society as a whole.
1.6.5.2.6.1. Pro: The existence of obese people forces firms to spend more to accommodate their larger bodies.
1.6.5.2.6.1.1. Pro: Rescue personnel need to put [more resources](http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/13/10/1029/pdf) into saving a very obese person's life during a disaster, preventing them from helping other survivors.
1.6.5.2.6.1.2. Pro: Insurance companies have to spend more to treat obese patients.
1.6.5.2.6.1.2.1. Pro: Insurance premiums rise for everyone to compensate for the health effects of obesity.
1.6.5.2.6.1.2.1.1. Pro: According to [one study](http://aepp.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/07/03/aepp.ppu014.abstract), public medical expenditures would decrease by about 15% if all obese Americans were in a normal weight range - or 747$ per year per adult.
1.6.5.2.6.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.2.4.1.
1.6.5.2.6.1.2.3. Pro: In 1995, US insurance companies spent $99.2 billion on obesity-related-care \([Puhl & Brownell, p. 794](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.490.4017&rep=rep1&type=pdf)\). This figure is likely to be higher today, as the rate of obesity has increased. These costs have to be carried by non-obese patients too.
1.6.5.2.6.1.2.4. Pro: Having an [extreme BMI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8078861) comes with higher expenditure on healthcare.
1.6.5.2.6.1.2.5. Con: Insurance companies set premiums accordingly.
1.6.5.2.6.1.3. Pro: Obese workers miss more work days than non-obese workers due to sickness, injuries or disabilities. According to numerous studies, this accounts for [9.3%](http://news.yale.edu/2014/11/14/obesity-among-american-workers-costs-nations-billions-lost-productivity) of all absenteeism costs and causes [billions](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18331420) in damages.
1.6.5.2.6.1.3.1. Con: The sedentary nature of [the modern workplace is a cause of obesity](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/26/health/nutrition/26fat.html). On balance, the harm that the employer does to the worker's health is greater than the harm absenteeism and other byproducts of obesity pose to the employer.
1.6.5.2.6.1.3.1.1. Pro: Companies have an obligation to support their employees' health.
1.6.5.2.6.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Rather than immediately jumping to an offender/offendee mindset where the obese are harming society and therefore should be made to pay, [we should instead look for the most efficient way](http://jaysonlusk.com/blog/2014/3/3/what-would-coase-say-about-obesity-externalities) of addressing the negative externalities of obesity.
1.6.5.2.6.1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: A reasonable solution would be to make society's payment of an obese individual's healthcare costs contingent on them working to lose weight.
1.6.5.2.6.1.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.6.5.2.6.1.3.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Employer healthcare-based [incentives](http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/01/08/462380096/why-employers-incentives-for-weight-loss-fall-flat-with-workers) did not result in employees losing weight.
1.6.5.2.6.1.3.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: There are other ways employers can encourage weight loss. For example, programs like [Health Wage](https://www.healthywage.com/) offer wellness challenges with cash prizes for personal or corporate team weight loss.
1.6.5.2.6.1.3.1.1.1.1.2.2. Con: One study found that employee [group-based](http://www.rwjf.org/en/library/articles-and-news/2013/04/group-based-incentives-for-weight-loss-produce-better-results.html) weight loss challenges with a financial reward produced better results than individuals' weight loss challenges.
1.6.5.2.6.1.3.1.1.1.1.3. Con: Withholding necessary medical care is cruel and inhumane.
1.6.5.2.6.1.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.14.2.3.3.3.
1.6.5.2.6.1.3.1.1.1.3. Con: It is necessary to know the extent of economic harm obesity does to society in order to address the negative externalities.
1.6.5.2.6.1.3.1.1.2. Pro: The profits of businesses depend on the health of their workers.
1.6.5.2.6.1.3.1.2. Con: Obesity [is not correlated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3550520/) with the time spent sitting at work.
1.6.5.2.6.1.3.2. Pro: A [study](http://www.cfah.org/hbns/2014/obese-employees-cost-employers-thousands-in-extra-medical-costs) found that an obese employee, on average, costs an employer 4,000 dollars more in healthcare and related costs than an employee with normal weight.
1.6.5.2.6.1.4. Con: Private companies' profit motive should not determine what society as a whole treats as acceptable.
1.6.5.2.6.1.4.1. Con: It can, when those increased costs are passed on to society writ large.
1.6.5.2.6.1.5. Pro: Obesity makes it more difficult to standardize elements of technology like [safety restraint](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Bishai/publication/7195342_Tipping_the_Scales_Obese_Children_and_Child_Safety_Seats/links/02e7e524186439cc5f000000.pdf) design.
1.6.5.2.6.1.6. Pro: Airline fuel costs rise and profitability declines as passengers grow larger. [Calculations](http://www.aircraftinteriorsinternational.com/articles.php?ArticleID=426) show that per-passenger fuel consumption and cost can easily increase by 60% for an obese passenger compared to a passenger of average weight.
1.6.5.2.6.2. Pro: Society writ large foots the bill for health problems caused by obesity.
1.6.5.2.6.2.1. Pro: Obesity related medical spending accounts for nearly [a fifth](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/obesity-prevention-source/obesity-consequences/economic/) of overall medical spending in the United States.
1.6.5.2.6.2.1.1. Pro: In 2010, [obesity](http://stopobesityalliance.org/uncategorized/more-than-35-leading-u-s-health-organizations-launch-campaign-to-improve-obesity-care/)-related healthcare costs in the US were estimated to be over $300 billion.
1.6.5.2.6.2.1.2. Con: Approximately [one third of the US population is obese](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/Pages/overweight-obesity-statistics.aspx). If society at large is footing the bill, obese people are paying a significant portion of the cost.
1.6.5.2.6.2.2. Pro: Health problems caused by obesity cost the economy [billions of dollars a year](http://stateofobesity.org/healthcare-costs-obesity/) in lost productivity.
1.6.5.2.6.2.2.1. Con: People are not solely workers, and are not obligated to sacrifice their personal happiness for the sake of productivity.
1.6.5.2.6.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.2.6.1.3.
1.6.5.2.6.2.2.3. Con: Free choice of diet and eating habits is an important factor in personal happiness. [Happier employees are more productive.](http://smf.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Social-Market-Foundation-Publication-Briefing-CAGE-4-Are-happy-workers-more-productive-281015.pdf)
1.6.5.2.6.2.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.2.6.2.1.
1.6.5.2.6.2.3. Pro: Paying for obese people's healthcare creates a [moral hazard](https://ideas.repec.org/p/ags/aaea15/206228.html), causing them to undervalue healthy behavior and be less likely to lose weight.
1.6.5.2.6.2.3.1. Con: It is unlikely that the availability of public healthcare would impact significantly on the eating or exercise habits and decisions of obese people.
1.6.5.2.6.2.3.1.1. Pro: People struggle to consider long-term consequences every time they eat a snack.
1.6.5.2.6.2.3.2. Con: Given that the health consequences of obesity accrue to the individual, moral hazard seems unlikely in this context.
1.6.5.2.6.2.4. Con: As a society, we have decided that having collective medical care is a good thing. Thus we should not critique people using it.
1.6.5.2.6.2.4.1. Con: Collective healthcare assumes that people generally want to be healthy, and thus will only use the medical system when they need it. Allowing yourself to become unhealthy is thus exploitative of society.
1.6.5.2.6.2.4.1.1. Con: Being obese is not automatically a sign that a person is [unhealthy](http://www.counselheal.com/articles/21366/20160208/obese-necessarily-unhealthy-ucla-researchers-claim.htm), just as having a "healthy" weight does not necessarily mean a person is in good health.
1.6.5.2.6.2.4.1.1.1. Con: There is no such thing as being overweight and healthy. Just being overweight puts one at [higher risk](http://www.bbc.com/news/health-39936138) for heart attack and stroke.
1.6.5.2.6.2.4.1.1.2. Con: Obesity is associated with many [health risks](https://www.asu.edu/courses/css335/da_whybad.html), and this means that society should disapprove of obesity as a choice people make, even if some people are obese and not unhealthy.
1.6.5.2.6.2.4.1.1.3. Pro: [Body mass index](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/265215.php), which is the most common form of measurement for obesity, has been shown to be inaccurate because it does not take into account bone density, muscle mass, overall composition, race, or sex - all contributing factors to the overall health of a person.
1.6.5.2.6.2.4.1.1.3.1. Con: However, the most common examples of BMI being misleading - such as body-builders - are [visibly not cases of obesity](http://metro.co.uk/2014/03/26/a-picture-of-obesity-nhs-tells-bodybuilder-she-must-lose-weight-and-exercise-more-4679903/), and thus will not be affected by societal shaming.
1.6.5.2.6.2.4.1.1.3.2. Con: While BMI may not be accurate for individuals considered normal or overweight, 99% of women and 95% of males identified as obese by BMI were [still defined](https://examine.com/nutrition/how-valid-is-bmi-as-a-measure-of-health-and-obesity/) as such via body fat levels.
1.6.5.2.6.2.4.1.1.3.3. Pro: 15% of people labeled obese based on BMI were considered 'healthy' when [assessed](http://www.medicaldaily.com/body-mass-index-bmi-calculator-healthy-weight-obesity-372852) with other, more accurate weight measurement tools.
1.6.5.2.6.2.4.1.1.4. Pro: Societal shame is likely to reinforce the belief that obesity is inherently unhealthy, an assumption which in some cases leads to [worse medical treatment](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/26/health/obese-patients-health-care.html) for obese patients.
1.6.5.2.6.2.4.1.1.5. Con: Society makes judgment calls about how to treat particular lifestyle choices even if they are not bad for everyone e.g. the criminalisation of drugs even though some people who take drugs may be harmless and unharmed.
1.6.5.2.6.2.4.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.6.5.2.6.2.5. Con: A lot of the financial harm is [centralized](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050029) to the obese individuals via out-of-pocket costs and higher insurance premiums, limiting the impact on society.
1.6.5.2.6.2.5.1. Con: This is only the case in countries without centralised, government-funded healthcare systems. This is not the situation in the majority of the developed world.
1.6.5.2.6.2.6. Con: -> See 1.6.5.2.6.2.1.2.
1.6.5.2.6.2.7. Con: There are many activities that give great pleasure to individuals and slightly harm the general public. In liberal democracies we accept that trade-off in order to let individuals pursue their happiness.
1.6.5.2.6.2.7.1. Pro: Drinking alcohol regularly [increases the chances of suffering](http://www.nhs.uk/Change4Life/Pages/alcohol-health-harms.aspx) i.e. a stroke, high-blood pressure, liver disease. However, it is socially acceptable to celebrate, relax or just drink in order to maximize the individual's happiness in a given moment.
1.6.5.2.6.2.7.2. Pro: Workaholism is an admired feature in many prestigious jobs such as lawyer, economic consultant, or graphic designer. [This lifestyle is frequently linked](http://www.realsimple.com/health/mind-mood/emotional-health/workaholism-psychiatric-disorders) to a wide range of psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, OCD, anxiety, and depression. It causes costs and problems for society, but can be also a legitimate way to pursue a career and have a happy life for any given person.
1.6.5.2.6.2.8. Con: Paying into a national healthcare system does not entitle someone to influence other citizens' personal health decisions.
1.6.5.2.6.2.8.1. Con: When this influence benefits society economically as a whole, it is warranted.
1.6.5.2.6.2.8.1.1. Con: -> See 1.6.5.2.6.2.7.
1.6.5.2.6.3. Con: With the rise of obesity, packaged food companies continue to see [rising profits](http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21568064-food-companies-play-ambivalent-part-fight-against-flab-food-thought). This impacts the economy, and thus society in a positive way.
1.6.5.2.6.3.1. Pro: Companies like Slimfast and Weight Watchers created multi-million dollar diet food brands that [profit annually](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/aug/07/fat-profits-food-industry-obesity) off the obese and over-weight community.
1.6.5.2.6.3.1.1. Con: Companies like SlimFast and Weight Watchers developed because of the existence of obesity. It would be better if obesity was not such a big problem in the first place.
1.6.5.2.6.3.1.2. Pro: The development of programs like SlimFast and Weight Watchers has increased the access to the healthy nutrition for people fighting with obesity.
1.6.5.2.6.3.1.2.1. Pro: Meal replacement diets are [just as effective](http://jn.nutrition.org/content/134/8/1894.short) as structured weight-loss plans.
1.6.5.2.6.3.1.2.2. Con: SlimFast and other meal replacement products have been [criticized](http://www.livestrong.com/article/265215-dangers-of-slim-fast/) for containing sugar, which may make them dangerous for diabetics and consumers who might already be at risk for developing diabetes.
1.6.5.2.6.3.2. Con: Most packaged foods are unhealthy. An increase in consumption of these foods can have a negative impact on health, and thus the economy as well.
1.6.5.2.6.3.3. Con: -> See 1.6.5.2.3.1.
1.6.5.2.6.3.4. Con: -> See 1.6.5.2.6.1.4.
1.6.5.2.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.2.6.2.2.
1.6.5.2.7. Con: Shaming obesity, and the policies that accompany it, will similarly have negative externalities.
1.6.5.2.7.1. Pro: For example, sin taxes on consumption \(like a proposed 'fat tax' or 'sugar tax'\) are often incredibly [regressive](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40722031?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents).
1.6.5.2.7.2. Pro: Shame is a particularly blunt instrument of social engineering, meaning that it often has impacts on a far broader group of people than it is intended to.
1.6.5.2.8. Con: Obesity can be considered a negative externality in and of itself \(e.g. when it occurs as a result of businesses failing to grant their employees sufficient time and money to live a healthy lifestyle\). It is therefore inefficient to target obesity rather than its root cause.
1.6.5.2.8.1. Con: Increasing social awareness of the problems that obesity causes will increase the pressures to employers to procure healthy working environments.
1.6.5.2.9. Con: Shaming obesity has gendered externalities, as it [hurts women more](http://www.amascriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Is_fat_feminist_issue.pdf) than men.
1.6.5.2.9.1. Pro: Women are [more adversely affected](http://cardozolawandgender.com/uploads/3/4/0/7/34074834/13-3_griffin.pdf) than men by weight-based discrimination in the workplace.
1.6.5.2.9.2. Pro: Obese female political candidates are [rated more negatively](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1038/oby.2009.492/full) in terms of reliability, dependability, honesty, ability to inspire, and ability to perform strenuous jobs than non-obese female candidates. Obese male candidates are rated more positively than non-obese male candidates.
1.6.5.2.9.3. Pro: [Women face weight discrimination](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/31/fat-bias-worse-for-women/?_r=0) at lower weights than men do, and this will only be made worse by a societal emphasis on shaming obese people.
1.6.5.2.9.4. Pro: Women are more susceptible to criticisms of their appearance than men are.
1.6.5.2.9.4.1. Pro: [80%](http://www.smh.com.au//breaking-news-national/poll-finds-women-unhappy-with-body-image-20100211-nto2.html) of Australian women are unhappy with their body.
1.6.5.3. Pro: Obese people can cause a lot of problems for others in daily life.
1.6.5.3.1. Con: Only [morbidly obese](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/highland/bariatric-surgery-center/questions/morbid-obesity.aspx) people are likely to require assistance. These represent only [8%](http://stateofobesity.org/fastfacts/) of the population.
1.6.5.3.1.1. Con: In developed countries, like the [US](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12365955), obesity rates are increasing.
1.6.5.3.2. Pro: Obese passengers take up more space in transportation and make travel uncomfortable for their fellow passengers.
1.6.5.3.2.1. Con: [Men](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-31/manspreading-debate-study-shows-stance-attractive/7285024) also take up excessive space on public transport, often unnecessarily and in a way which makes others feel uncomfortable, yet we don't shame them.
1.6.5.3.2.1.1. Con: Increasing discussion about the issue of '[manspreading](http://www.gender-focus.com/2016/02/13/manspreading/)' suggests that men are being shamed for taking up space when it could be avoided.
1.6.5.3.3. Pro: Obese people often require assistance with daily activities such as showering and getting dressed, which is a burden on their family and/or friends.
1.6.5.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.6.5.3.1.
1.6.5.3.3.2. Con: We don't shame the disabled for burdening those around them.
1.6.5.3.3.2.1. Con: Disability differs from obesity, because obesity is the result of past deliberate decisions, while in the vast majority of cases disability is caused by unfortunate circumstances or birth lottery. Therefore, an obese person is responsible for creating the additional burden for other people, which cannot be said about the disabled person.
1.6.5.3.3.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.6.5.3.3.3. Pro: Family or friends who take care of an obese person rarely have a choice about doing so.
1.6.5.3.3.3.1. Con: Family and friends always have that choice. There is no legal requirement to care for an adult relative.
1.6.5.3.3.4. Con: People who assume a care-giver role generally do so out of a genuine desire and place of friendship/love.
1.6.5.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.2.3.
1.6.5.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.2.6.
1.6.5.4. Pro: Society only wishes for them to change two behaviors: their diet and exercise. And this for a limited time only.
1.6.5.4.1. Con: Changes in diet may not be possible.
1.6.5.4.2. Con: Diet change and exercise alone may not be sufficient to correct obesity
1.6.5.4.3. Con: Diet and lifestyle changes must be maintained for the rest of one's life, not for a limited time only, if one expects not to regain all lost weight.
1.6.6. Con: Freedom of choice does not necessarily entail freedom from criticism, as is the case here. People are still able to choose to be obese, they just have to be willing to bear the consequences that accompany it.
1.7. Con: At certain times in history, obesity was considered attractive, as it was a [symbol of wealth and status](http://centreformedicalhumanities.org/the-metamorphoses-of-fat-a-history-of-obesity-reviewed-by-dr-katherine-harvey/). We should not assume that our current values are correct.
1.7.1. Pro: Research shows that preferences in body size are not innate but flexible, and depend on circumstance and environment: stressed-out men, for example, have been [found](http://healthland.time.com/2012/08/09/why-stressed-out-men-prefer-heavier-women/) to prefer heavier women.
1.7.1.1. Con: This can be explained by the fact that obesity is a biological indicator of excess \(e.g. food, resources\). This would intuitively be perceived as attractive to stressed men, as said excess may relieve said stress \(assuming most stress roots from economic security\).
1.7.2. Con: It was considered attractive because it was a sign of wealth. You had to be rich to eat enough to get that fat. Nowadays, this is no longer the case, almost anyone can do it. Obesity is not a status symbol in the western world.
1.7.3. Con: Throughout history, values have progressed in good ways. The fact that we used to value something in the past is not inherently an argument that it was ever a good idea.
1.7.3.1. Con: Generally, what we consider positive changes in societal values are our increased acceptance of diversity and increased condemnation of behaviors that hurt others. The idea that fat people should not be accepted and should in fact be shamed runs counter to both ideas of positive change in societal values.
1.7.3.2. Pro: There is a general decline and distaste for [violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Better_Angels_of_Our_Nature).
1.7.3.3. Pro: Society is now less racist and homophobic than it was.
1.7.3.3.1. Con: We should continue the trend of becoming less discriminatory by stopping discrimination against the obese.
1.7.3.3.2. Con: During the 1920s, Western society [admired](http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/05/05/when-europe-loved-islam-interwar-weimar-republic-wilmersdorf-mosque/) Islam, or an idealized version of it that was in fashion then, while today anti-Muslim sentiment is rampant.
1.7.3.3.2.1. Con: An individual case in which society has arguably gotten worse does not eliminate the various other ways in which society is now less racist.
1.7.3.3.2.2. Pro: The [European Islamophobia Report](http://www.islamophobiaeurope.com/executive-summary/2016-2/) defines Islamophobia as "anti-Muslim racism", and observes that it has been on the rise since 2015 and poses a danger to Muslims living in Europe.
1.7.3.3.3. Pro: It is acknowledged that racial prejudices in the US reduced over the course of the last five decades \([Devine et al., p.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3603687/pdf/nihms396358.pdf)\).
1.7.3.3.4. Pro: White Americans are now [less likely \(than in 1985\) to believe](https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/attitudes-toward-racism-and-inequality-are-shifting/) that racial inequality is due to inborn ability.
1.7.3.3.5. Pro: White Americans are now [less likely \(than they were in the 1980s\) to support](https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/attitudes-toward-racism-and-inequality-are-shifting/) homeowners being able to refuse potential buyers on the basis of race.
1.7.3.3.6. Pro: The General Social Survey, a major poll tracking Americans' attitudes on key social issues, [no longer includes questions about segregating schools](https://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/race-society/white-racial-attitudes-over-time-data-general-social-survey), because support dropped too low to be worth tracking.
1.7.3.3.7. Pro: [LGBT rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_social_movements) have advanced considerably in the last decades.
1.7.4. Pro: Obesity is still considered beautiful in many cultures, such as in [Mauritania.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/3429903.stm)
1.7.4.1. Con: The perception of obesity as an attractive trait is largely based in the fact that weight is indicative of wealth and/or prosperity \(i.e. "excess"\), and therefore is likely only appealing in the context of impoverished cultures.
1.7.5. Con: Shaming obesity is based on scientific evidence of the health consequences caused by obesity, and the healthcare costs that entails, not on value judgments.
1.7.5.1. Pro: Extensive and massive studies show that it is not possible to be healthy as long as you are [overweight](http://www.bbc.com/news/health-39936138). Just being overweight puts one at higher risk for stroke and hearth attack.
1.7.5.2. Con: Based on the vitriol used in the condemnation, the disgust surrounding obesity, and the simple fact that you can't tell someone's health just by looking at them, this is, if not outright false, far from the whole story.
1.7.5.3. Con: Many other lifestyles and conditions that are bad for one's health are not stigmatised in the same way by society.
1.7.5.3.1. Pro: Dieting is normalised and celebrated, even though a culture that does so has been linked to high rates of anorexia.
1.7.5.3.1.1. Pro: Thirty-five percent of 'normal dieters' will progress to pathological dieting. Within that, 20-25% will progress to having a full-blown eating disorder like [anorexia](http://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/CollegiateSurveyProject).
1.7.5.3.2. Pro: Being chronically sleep-deprived is perfectly socially acceptable, and yet may be as [harmful to health](http://waubrafoundation.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Banks-S.-Dinges-D.F.-Behavioral-and-Physiological-Consequences-of-Sleep-Restriction.pdf) as smoking or obesity.
1.7.5.3.2.1. Con: Sleep deprivation is considered socially acceptable as it is often associated with hard work. Obesity has no such positive association.
1.7.5.3.2.1.1. Con: We should base our healthcare policy on medical science rather than cultural beliefs about what unhealthy behaviors are or are not acceptable.
1.7.5.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: Lack of sleep shortens your life expectancy and puts you at [risk of serious ​medical conditions](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/tiredness-and-fatigue/Pages/lack-of-sleep-health-risks.aspx) such as obesity, heart disease, and diabetes.
1.7.5.3.2.2. Con: Insofar as it has significant negative health consequences, society should shame chronic sleep-deprivation too.
1.7.5.3.3. Con: Society uses its coercive shaming power to shape society as it sees fit. This includes things like shaming smoking and not vaccinating children that create an unhealthy society.
1.7.5.4. Con: Research is not unambiguous and scientific studies have been used throughout history to support various agendas and interests.
1.7.5.4.1. Pro: Companies [such as Coca Cola](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/coca-cola-funds-scientists-who-shift-blame-for-obesity-away-from-bad-diets/?mtrref=undefined&gwh=F659FB2B85AD5701D16BD8BC22DB2B67&gwt=pay) have in the past supported researchers to 'scientifically' shift the blame for obesity away from factors such as diet.
1.7.5.4.2. Pro: The tobacco industry has a long history of funding and promoting research that supports its agendas, for example about the [effects of second-hand smoke](http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/welcome/features/20071114_cardio-tobacco/).
1.7.5.4.3. Pro: In the 1960s, The Sugar Research Foundation \(SRF\) downplayed the link between [sugar](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/13/493739074/50-years-ago-sugar-industry-quietly-paid-scientists-to-point-blame-at-fat) and coronary heart disease \(CHD\), instead pointing the finger at fat.
1.7.5.4.4. Con: These examples are all examples of industry funding research to fuel their profits. The healthcare industry would not profit from a reduction in obesity in the same way, so has no such motive.
1.7.5.5. Con: What we consider scientific evidence today might be seen as bogus tomorrow, just as many other supposedly scientific insights from the past were ultimately abandoned.
1.7.5.5.1. Pro: Many scientific fields are assumed to face a [replication crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis) as large swathes of scientific studies can not be replicated and are thus highly questionable. Among researchers in the medical field, [more than half](http://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970?WT.mc_id=SFB_NNEWS_1508_RHBox) have failed to reproduce experiments.
1.7.5.6. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.2.6.2.1.
1.7.5.7. Con: -> See 1.6.5.2.6.2.4.1.1.
1.7.5.8. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.3.
1.7.5.9. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.2.
1.7.5.10. Pro: Obesity can have serious negative impacts on people's physical and mental wellbeing.
1.7.5.10.1. Con: The negative effect of obesity on one's mental wellbeing is due primarily to society condoning the shaming of obesity.
1.7.5.10.1.1. Con: The majority of society is obese. This would mean that the majority of society is shaming themselves. This seems logically impossible.
1.7.5.10.1.2. Con: In Western societies, i.e. societies with high obesity rates, being overweight is the new normal - overweight people have been shown to underestimate the extent of their obesity. Unless someone is morbidly obese, it is likely that their being overweight will go entirely uncommented, while naturally slim people are told to eat more or that they are too thin.
1.7.5.10.2. Con: Even if shaming unhealthy behaviors is justified, it is not definitively clear that obesity is always unhealthy.
1.7.5.10.2.1. Con: There is [substantial research](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/en/) linking obesity to chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease \(leading cause of death in 2012\), musculoskeletal disorders, and even some cancers.
1.7.5.10.2.2. Pro: Obese people who are metabolically healthy [do exist](http://www.jci.org/articles/view/78425/version/1/pdf/render) and they avoid the bad side effects of moderate weight gain.
1.7.5.10.2.2.1. Con: There are healthy smokers, but one would never argue that smoking in itself is not unhealthy. Same with obesity; it has been shown to be a risk factor for many health conditions so the average obese person is at higher risk, even if there are exceptions to the rule.
1.7.5.10.2.2.2. Con: “Healthy obesity” is merely a [preliminary stage](http://www.onlinejacc.org/content/65/1/101) of unhealthy obesity.
1.7.5.10.2.2.3. Con: Even if a person is metabolically healthy, other risks \(e.g. cancer, arthritis and respiratory disease\) do remain.
1.7.5.10.2.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.2.6.2.4.1.1.
1.7.5.10.3. Con: Most people actively make choices that ultimately harm their health like a sedentary life, unhealthy diet, drinking, smoking, lack of quality sleep or exposure to stress by overworking; should we shame everyone then?
1.7.5.10.4. Con: Society's condemnation of obesity causes a significant portion of the lower well-being of obese people.
1.7.5.10.5. Pro: Obesity makes surgeries more [difficult](http://health.usnews.com/health-news/patient-advice/articles/2016-04-11/too-fat-for-surgery) and hospital stays longer.
1.7.5.10.6. Pro: Obese people suffer from physical illness that can even lead to death.
1.7.5.10.6.1. Pro: Obese women have [higher death rates](http://annals.org/aim/article/713432/obesity-barrier-screening-cervical-breast-cancer) from cervical and breast cancer than healthy-weight women.
1.7.5.10.6.2. Pro: Obesity, including [metabolic obesity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22871870) can have [health risks](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/obe/risks) including increased likelihood of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and strokes.
1.7.5.10.6.2.1. Con: A [study](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/weight-loss-does-not-lower-heart-disease-risk-type-2-diabetes) of 5,145 people with type 2 diabetes has shown that a change of lifestyle, i.e. intensive diet and exercise program resulting in weight loss, does not reduce heart attacks and strokes. \(There were other beneficial health effects\).
1.7.5.10.6.3. Pro: The number one cause of [obstructive sleep apnea](http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-apnea/obstructive-sleep-apnea-causes#1) in adults is obesity.
1.7.5.10.6.4. Pro: [Endocrine abnormalities](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14711067), such as thyroid dysfunction and PCOS \(Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome\), are commonly reported as causative and secondary factors in obese individuals.
1.7.5.10.6.5. Con: Overweight and obese people are at [no greater risk](http://healthland.time.com/2012/09/05/can-you-be-fat-and-fit-or-thin-and-unhealthy/) of developing/dying from heart disease or cancer than normal weight people, as long as they are metabolically fit.
1.7.5.10.6.5.1. Con: The link you submitted expose that only half of the obese people considered were metabolically fit, and all of them did go to the gym. This means that way less than that percentage of the obese population may be considered metabolically fit and as such having greater health  risks.
1.7.5.10.6.5.2. Con: There are many other serious health risks for obese individuals that threaten their quality of life. These should also be taken into consideration.
1.7.5.10.6.6. Con: The world population is nearly double what is sustainable and growing at a faster rate than at any other time in recorded history. Humans are on a crash course for mass extinction. Things that shorten lifespan, thin the population or slow population growth should be encouraged \(obesity, addiction, non-procreative sexual behavior, high risk activities, etc.\)
1.7.5.10.6.7. Pro: Insulin resistance causes metabolic syndrome, obesity, T2D, T3D, gout, some cancer, arthritis, dementia, and heart disease.  Supported by Gary Taubes in his books 'Good Calories Bad Calories', 'Why We Get Fat', and 'The Case Against Sugar'.[Why do we get fat?](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-taubes-why-we-get-fat-20160511-story.html)
1.7.5.10.7. Pro: Obese people suffer from mental health problems.
1.7.5.10.7.1. Con: Obesity may be the result of mental health conditions, not the cause, because people might turn to overeating for comfort or even as a form of self-punishment.
1.7.5.10.7.2. Pro: There is a correlation between obesity and lower than optimal [mental health](http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v22/n6/abs/0800617a.html) and [mental disorders](http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v25/n1s/abs/0801688a.html).
1.7.5.10.7.2.1. Con: Many of the mental health harms related to obesity are the direct result of the social stigma attached to it. If we stop shaming obese people they will feel better about themselves and their mental health will improve.
1.7.5.10.7.2.2. Pro: Children who have [low self-esteem](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8248768.stm) are more likely to be obese as adults.
1.7.5.10.7.2.3. Con: This is also plausibly because society shames obesity already. If it did not, it conceivably would change this.
1.7.5.10.7.2.4. Con: Correlation can imply causation in either direction - it is equally plausible that these mental conditions contribute to the chance of someone becoming obese.

1.7.5.10.8. Pro: Overall wellbeing is lower for obese people.
1.7.5.10.8.1. Pro: Studies conducted among [adolescents in the United States](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X12000640), [among women in Australia](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1038/oby.2004.125/full), and [in Germany](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=YKzsCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA21&lpg=PA21&dq=obesity+survey+satisfaction&source=bl&ots=uOZ6q4aVgL&sig=Tcyr3YMGn4YBkSwtUf6Eu-feM8M&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjlnIjHz_rPAhVGJZQKHQ2DDQ04ChDoAQgsMAM#v=onepage&q=obesity%20survey%20satisfaction&f=false) \(p. 27\) all indicate that obesity leads to a lower life satisfaction.
1.7.5.10.8.1.1. Con: The relation between obesity and life satisfaction has been called into question, for example because [the social context matters](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24872467). In places with low obesity rates, obese people are more unhappy compared to non-obese people than in places with high obesity rates. Obesity itself is thus only one factor that influences life satisfaction.
1.7.5.10.8.1.2. Con: -> See 1.7.5.10.7.2.3.
1.7.5.10.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.15.2.1.6.6.
1.7.5.10.8.3. Pro: Health care professionals advise their obese patients to lose weight in [less than 50%](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/192021) of cases. This 'selective advising' as a result of patient bias can lead to the onset, or worsening, of obesity-related health issues.
1.7.5.10.8.3.1. Pro: Doctors appear [judgemental](http://www.davidkatzmd.com/admin/archives/Obesity%20be%20Dammed.Katz.Fall-06.pdf) about their patients' weight and thus disregard other health concerns.
1.7.5.10.8.3.2. Con: Even if doctors are biased they will still advise and treat obese people because it is their job.
1.7.5.10.8.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.7.5.10.8.3.1.
1.7.5.10.8.3.3. Con: Many doctors specialize in obesity research.
1.7.5.10.8.3.3.1. Pro: Obesity research has an [academic journal](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/obesity-research-and-clinical-practice) of its own.
1.7.5.10.8.3.3.2. Pro: There are obesity research programs at universities, for example at [John Hopkins](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/gim/research/content/obesity.html) and [UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/obesity).
1.7.5.10.8.3.3.3. Pro: The US [National Institute of Health](https://www.obesityresearch.nih.gov/) has its own obesity research program.
1.7.5.10.9. Con: -> See 1.7.5.10.6.5.
1.7.5.11. Con: Many prevailing stereotypes are negative and discriminatory value judgements, such as the ["fat people are lazy"-myth](http://sciencenordic.com/overweight-people-are-not-lazy-and-dumb), which is not supported by [scientific evidence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn0Ygp7pMbA&feature=youtu.be).
1.7.6. Con: Society changes all the time, and people act in accordance with current societal expectations. In the status quo, obesity is considered shameful, so people follow those norms.
1.8. Con: Acceptance of fat bodies is a valuable counterbalancing message to narratives of 'wellness' and 'thinspo' that are pervasive within society.
1.8.1. Pro: The aspirational beauty norm of thinness already makes average sized people less happy with their bodies. Shaming obesity on top of that makes them even more likely to be self-conscious.
1.8.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.2.9.4.1.
1.8.1.2. Con: If average-sized people are feeling irrationally bad about their bodies right now, there is no reason to believe that fat acceptance would suddenly enlighten them.
1.8.2. Pro: 'Thinspo' narratives are equally harmful to people's health and wellbeing as being overweight.
1.8.2.1. Pro: For example, there exists a culture around dieting, which negatively impacts many people's health and happiness.
1.8.2.2. Pro: Anorexia Nervosa is the single [most deadly](http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/eating-disorders/anorexia-nervosa/news/20110711/deadliest-psychiatric-disorder-anorexia) mental illness.
1.8.3. Con: Society is moving away from beauty norms centring around thinness, and towards ones which emphasise health, like ['fitspo' culture](http://elitedaily.com/life/girls-should-get-strong/1231871/).
1.8.3.1. Con: These still privilege a body type that is unattainable for the vast majority of people.
1.8.4. Con: Two harmful narratives don't necessarily balance out to one healthy one, instead they polarise each other further.
1.8.5. Con: People who are susceptible to these narratives are unlikely to internalise a message of fat acceptance, even if it is widespread in society.
1.8.5.1. Con: People who follow current fashion trends are likely to follow future trends too. While not embracing an obese body image they will become more lenient towards it once fashion acknowledges it; after all, they follow fashion.
1.8.6. Pro: Where 'thinspo' groups seek to create a culture of exclusivity and are broadly critical of average bodies, 'thickspo' groups [seek to be inclusive](http://www.cyberpsychology.eu/view.php?cisloclanku=2016063001), and are positive towards all bodies.
1.8.6.1. Con: Many individuals in the body positive movement speak ill of fit and healthy people, creating an exclusive culture.
1.8.6.2. Con: [Measurements](http://www.cyberpsychology.eu/view.php?cisloclanku=2016063001) used in the cited study are subjective. 'Negativity' was not assigned in methodical sound way but based on the author's judgement.
1.8.6.3. Con: A study focusing on 800 Instagram posts is hardly representative of the wider population.
1.8.7. Con: Acceptance of fat bodies makes it less likely that people will take steps to improve their health. Obesity is never healthy, and is the clear result of decades of insulin resistance, not overeating or a sedentary lifestyle, the usual culprits.

1.11. Pro: Obese people are considered [disgusting](http://www.breitbart.com/milo/2016/09/22/milo-explains-fat-shaming-good/) by many.
1.11.1. Con: People rate smokers or drug addicts as more disgusting than obese people but do not shame them \([Vartanian, p. 1304](http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v34/n8/pdf/ijo201045a.pdf)\).
1.11.1.1. Con: Smoking is excluded from public places.
1.11.1.2. Con: Broad definitions of "shaming" will apply to smoking as well.
1.11.2. Pro: Disgust is the best explanation of why people hold negative attitudes towards obese people \([Vartanian, p. 1306](http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v34/n8/pdf/ijo201045a.pdf)\).
1.11.2.1. Con: This is not a justification for shaming.
1.11.3. Pro: On social media, there are many expressions of disgust towards obese people.
1.11.3.1. Pro: There is a blog named '[Crusade against Fat People](https://wehatefatpeople.wordpress.com/)'.
1.11.3.2. Pro: John Burk's video on fat shaming went [viral](http://people.com/celebrity/overweight-people-repulsive-and-disgusting-according-to-john-burk/).
1.11.3.3. Pro: One of the very few subreddits shut down by Reddit, r/fatpeoplehate, was devoted to [shaming obese people](http://www.theverge.com/2015/6/10/8761763/reddit-harassment-ban-fat-people-hate-subreddit).
1.11.4. Pro: Conservative political ideology holds anti-obese attitudes \([Crandall, p. 887](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8014833)\).
1.11.4.1. Pro: Some in the alt-right movement express their disgust publicly, like [Milo Yiannopoulos](http://www.breitbart.com/milo/2016/09/22/milo-explains-fat-shaming-good/).
1.11.5. Con: Societies that do not focus on US values like self-determination and internal control exhibit less dislike for obese people, as is the case in Brazil \([Crandall, p. 892](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8014833)\).
1.11.6. Con: That people consider obese people disgusting is no moral justification for that position, or giving social force to it.
1.11.6.1. Pro: The LGBTQ+ community is also considered 'disgusting' by many people, but that is considered a tragedy of ignorance, not a justification for shaming.
1.12. Con: This would normalize societal shaming aimed against people's personal choices, making it more likely that society will begin to shame other behaviors and become more intrusive into individuals' lives.
1.12.1. Con: Where the personal choices of individuals cause harm to society as a whole, society should actively discourage the behavior in question.
1.12.1.1. Con: The harms obesity inflicts on society are few and trivial.
1.12.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.2.6.
1.12.1.3. Con: This process does not work in a one-way fashion. Not only do obese people harm society; society also does harm to them and is part of the reason for why they are obese in the first place. Assigning all blame to them is thus unfair.
1.12.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.15.2.1.
1.12.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.2.6.1.3.1.
1.12.1.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.15.4.3.4.
1.12.1.4. Pro: Smoking is a personal choice considered unacceptable because of the health risks to the smoker and those who may experience the unhealthy effects of[secondhand smoke](http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/secondhand_smoke/health_effects/).
1.12.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.14.2.4.2.
1.12.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.2.4.
1.12.1.7. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.2.5.
1.12.2. Con: Society should shame unhealthy behaviors like obesity in general.
1.12.2.1. Pro: If we don't shame unhealthy behaviors then it becomes a social norm to be unhealthy and promotes laziness within our society.
1.12.2.2. Con: Public opinion about what constitutes healthy behavior is often horribly misinformed, such as the [once-commonplace belief](http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/eating-fat-makes-you-fat-idea-debunked-dietitian-1.3206180) that eating fat causes high cholesterol and heart disease.
1.12.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.14.2.3.3.
1.12.2.4. Con: -> See 1.1.12.
1.12.2.5. Con: Shame can cause harm to the health of those shamed.
1.12.2.5.1. Pro: [Shaming or weight discrimination](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25212272) promotes [weight gain](https://authoritynutrition.com/fat-shaming-makes-things-worse/) and obesity, by making the target feel worse about themselves.
1.12.2.5.1.1. Pro: [Stress increases cortisol](http://www.news-medical.net/health/Obesity-and-stress.aspx), which can encourage an increase in food intake, thus adding to their health issues and the challenge of obesity, rather than inspiring healthier habits.
1.12.2.5.1.2. Pro: The emotional upset from being 'fat-shamed' can cause some to feel less in control of their food cravings.
1.12.2.5.1.3. Pro: Women who watched videos of fat shaming ate [3 times as many calories](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21760636) afterwards in comparison to women who watched a non-stigmatizing video.
1.12.2.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.2.6.2.4.1.1.4.
1.12.2.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.14.
1.12.2.5.4. Pro: Telling people that their bodies are socially unacceptable does not help them lose weight.
1.12.2.5.4.1. Pro: If shaming[reduced obesity](http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2nx1p3hs.pdf), the obesity epidemic would not have become this severe.
1.12.2.5.4.1.1. Pro: Obesity is already [intensely stigmatized](http://journals2.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/pdf/00219029/v41i0008/1981_wiantetlvowb.xml) and yet the obesity epidemic continues.
1.12.2.5.4.1.2. Con: This does not mean shaming does not work. It does however indicate a need to implement other shaming techniques.
1.12.2.5.4.2. Pro: People who are made to feel ashamed of their weight have been [shown to have worse health](http://www.shape.com/lifestyle/mind-and-body/science-fat-shaming) than those who are not shamed.
1.12.2.5.4.2.1. Pro: Body shame prevents people from [going to the gym](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/helen-osborne/is-body-shame-keeping-you-from-gym_b_5257804.html).
1.12.2.5.4.2.1.1. Con: There are many ways to engage in physical exercise without going to the gym \(e.g. working out at home or outdoors\).
1.12.2.5.4.2.2. Pro: Fat shaming can encourage and exacerbate eating disorders.
1.12.2.5.4.2.2.1. Pro: Shame is a key emotion associated with Bulimia nervosa, an eating disorder prevalent in obese and overweight populations. Being shamed would [increase the severity](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7523258_Shame_and_severity_of_bulimic_symptoms) of bulimic symptoms.
1.12.2.5.4.2.2.2. Pro: External shaming has a [direct effect](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26689603) on binge eating severity, which can result in more weight gain.
1.12.2.5.4.2.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.12.2.5.1.
1.12.2.5.4.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.12.2.5.1.
1.12.2.5.4.3. Pro: Women are [more successful in losing weight](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Danu_Stinson/publication/267157848_A_little_acceptance_is_good_for_your_health_Interpersonal_messages_and_weight_change_over_time/links/545260b00cf26d5090a3702b.pdf) if their partners express satisfaction with their current body.
1.12.2.5.4.3.1. Con: Women may be more successful at losing weight when someone they love and care about expresses satisfaction, but this does not mean they will have the same success with society's approval.
1.12.2.5.4.3.1.1. Con: It does, however, indicate that approval and validation has a positive impact on physical health. While the link may not be established in research, it is plausible that the same would hold true for other significant figures in someone's life.
1.12.2.5.4.3.2. Pro: When society treats obesity as "unacceptable", it is less likely that women will receive this validation from their partners.
1.12.2.5.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.12.2.5.4.2.1.
1.12.2.5.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.12.2.5.4.2.2.2.
1.12.2.5.4.6. Pro: -> See 1.12.2.5.1.
1.12.2.5.4.7. Con: Social pressure might not help overweight people to lose weight, yet it might deter people from getting obese in the first place. This would be beneficial in the long-term.
1.12.2.5.4.7.1. Con: We cannot ignore the negative effects shaming has on obese people just because it would help non-obese people.
1.12.2.5.4.7.2. Con: The harm to the obese is far more prevalent and devastating than the potential benefit to the non-obese.
1.12.2.5.4.7.3. Pro: Social pressure can be an effective deterrent. The decline of smoking rates among American youths since the 1970s has been linked to the simultaneous rise of a social climate that disapproves of and stigmatizes smoking \(see [Koop, p. 409](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=SLqoF-MZxUMC&pg=PA409&lpg=PA409&dq=smoking+prevention+social+climate&source=bl&ots=9YDjCW_VXO&sig=TH6X1agy0z3Ss29F8cnGfxNg6Vk&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjRn6vA3frPAhVHHpQKHWnuBiwQ6AEIUjAG#v=onepage&q=smoking%20prevention%20social%20climate&f=false) and [Gallup](http://www.gallup.com/poll/187592/young-adults-cigarette-down-sharply.aspx) for current smoking rates\).
1.12.2.5.4.7.3.1. Con: -> See 1.12.2.5.4.1.1.
1.12.2.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.12.2.5.4.2.2.
1.12.2.5.6. Pro: Given evidence that non-obese people can live unhealthy lifestyles and suffer from [similar health risks](https://www.ahealthiermichigan.org/2014/08/15/skinny-but-unhealthy-the-truth-is-on-the-inside/) to obese people, it is unfair to only shame obese people on the basis of using size as a marker for health.
1.12.2.6. Con: Shaming is a restriction of freedom of choice.
1.12.2.6.1. Pro: People have the right to determine their own health choices independently. Shaming someone for their decisions functionally erects barriers to them making those same decisions in the first place and in the future.
1.12.2.6.1.1. Con: This is not making their decisions for them, just society trying to influence the decision.
1.12.2.6.2. Con: Even if this is restricting choice, it is doing so in a good way.
1.12.2.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.5.3.3.
1.12.2.6.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.13.
1.12.2.6.2.3. Con: Promoting healthy choices is possible without shaming people who are currently obese.
1.12.2.7. Pro: We generally assume that an individual's right to freedom of choice and expression extends only insofar as it begins to infringe on the rights of another, which obesity and other unhealthy behaviours do by increasing healthcare costs for everyone.
1.12.2.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.14.2.4.2.
1.12.2.9. Con: -> See 1.6.5.2.6.2.7.
1.12.2.10. Pro: Shame is how society self-regulates behaviour that should not be criminal, but is not conducive to an "ideal" society \(e.g. racism\). Given that obesity and other unhealthy behaviours do harm not only to individuals, but to society writ large, this is an appropriate use of society's power.
1.12.2.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.2.6.2.1.
1.12.2.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.2.6.2.2.
1.12.2.10.3. Con: Society uses its coercive shaming power to regulate interpersonal behavior, not individual decisions.
1.12.2.10.3.1. Pro: We generally agree that people should be able to make decisions that impact only themselves, even if they're dangerous or unhealthy, such as drinking alcohol.
1.12.2.10.3.1.1. Con: Many societies have cultural taboos against certain behaviors, even when done in private.
1.12.2.10.3.2. Con: -> See 1.7.5.3.3.
1.12.3. Pro: This trend already exists, as seen in the gradual intensification of anti-smoking campaigns.
1.12.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.12.2.5.4.7.3.
1.12.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.14.2.3.1.2.
1.12.4. Con: Many types of behavior are [worthy](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/public-shaming) of shame, such as environmental destruction ordered by CEOs of Shell.
1.12.5. Pro: It should be acceptance to live in a way that makes you comfortable even if that lifestyle has negative effects on your health.
1.13. Con: Obese people are already discriminated against. Shaming them reinforces the underlying bias that leads to discrimination.
1.13.1. Con: Discriminating against obese people tends to be reasonable. High weight makes basic activities, sports, and even surgeries significantly more risky to perform. Discrimination of a poor lifestyle choice is also necessary to disincentivize that choice.
1.13.1.1. Con: Many physical conditions and characteristics increase risk \(e.g. prior sports related injury may increase risk during later sports activity\). No physical characteristic or condition justifies discrimination.
1.13.2. Con: Peoples feelings should not be protected more so than their health. If you allow someone to stay overweight, to the point where it threatens their health, because it would hurt their feelings to tell them that not loosing weight is unacceptable, you are not doing them a favor, you are a detriment to their health.
1.13.3. Con: Discrimination based on personal choices is acceptable. If I do not want people in my life that smoke excessively even when I ask them to stop, that is my right. I have no obligation to include people when I don't want to.
1.13.4. Con: There is a big difference between shaming and 'not accepting'. I would not shame my child for being obese. However, I would also not accept the fact that my child is obese, as accepting it would trivialize a huge health risk to my child.
1.13.4.1. Con: Children are keenly aware of not being accepted. Such feelings can do lasting harm and create feelings of shame.
1.13.4.2. Con: Parents have an ethical obligation to unconditional love of their children. Shaming a child'd body is known to cause lasting harm.
1.13.5. Pro: Published research shows that stigmatizing a persons weight actually results in decreased desire to engage in healthy exercise. See the Rudd Center [uconnruddcenter.org](http://www.uconnruddcenter.org/weight-bias-stigma)
1.13.6. Pro: Obese people face discrimination in economic life.
1.13.6.1. Pro: Wage growth rates were 6% lower for obese individuals in the 1980s \([Loh, p. 434](http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/9311103801/economic-effects-physical-appearance)\).
1.13.6.2. Pro: Obese women earn [12%](http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/64138420/wage-effects-obesity-among-young-workers) less than non-obese women.
1.13.6.3. Pro: Many obese people lose their job because of obesity.
1.13.6.3.1. Pro: [Sharon Russell](http://www.radiancemagazine.com/issues/1991/supreme_challenge.html) was kicked out of nursing school because of her obesity.
1.13.6.3.2. Pro: [Doretha Smaw](http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/862/1469/2081604/) lost her job as police trooper because she failed to lose weight.
1.13.6.3.3. Pro: [Mary Nedder](http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/944/111/1485976/) lost her position as assistant professor because of obesity.
1.13.7. Pro: Many medical professionals are [biased](http://www.livescience.com/24619-doctors-bias-overweight-obese.html) against overweight people.
1.13.7.1. Con: Doctors also often refrain from addressing a patient's obesity, either because they don't recognize it, because they have accepted that people are often unable or unwilling to lose weight or because they lack the tools and resources to help with diet interventions.
1.13.7.2. Pro: Doctors are [nicer](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/29/overweight-patients-face-bias/?_r=0) to thin people.
1.13.7.3. Con: Doctors see terribly sick people all the time. They are used to being exposed to people that differ from the norm.
1.13.7.4. Con: Doctors treat patients with a [medical gaze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birth_of_the_Clinic#The_medical_gaze) that transforms patients into objects by separating the patient's identity from the body.
1.13.7.5. Pro: -> See 1.7.5.10.8.3.
1.13.7.6. Pro: -> See 1.7.5.10.8.3.1.

1.13.7.8. Con: -> See 1.7.5.10.8.3.3.
1.13.7.9. Pro: Rather than normalise their discrimination, we should treat their bias as unacceptable, and invest in appropriate training to ensure this problem is corrected.
1.13.8. Pro: Obese children are very likely to experience harassment and not succeed in education.
1.13.8.1. Con: Children are less likely to become obese if the lifestyle is stigmatized.
1.13.8.2. Pro: Nearly [every](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9814386) adolescent obese girl experiences stigmatization.
1.13.8.3. Pro: 91% of children feel ashamed for being fat \([Puhl & Brownell, p. 796](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.490.4017&rep=rep1&type=pdf)\).
1.13.8.4. Pro: Obese children have a more difficult time getting admitted to college \([Puhl & Brownell, p. 796](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.490.4017&rep=rep1&type=pdf)\).
1.13.8.5. Pro: [Parents](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167295217007) give less financial support to their obese children than non-obese children.
1.13.9. Pro: -> See 1.1.14.2.4.
1.13.10. Con: Citizens encouraging one another for better Health will have positive effect. Especially if all citizens are encouraging those with higher risk\(Obesity\) to try improve their Health status.
1.13.10.1. Con: Encouraging each other is not the same as treating certain lifestyles as outright unacceptable, which is what the original claim demands.
1.13.11. Con: It does not necessarily follow that because a choice is discouraged, that choice is necessarily shamed.
1.13.11.1. Con: -> See 1.1.14.2.3.1.1.
1.14. Con: All people who respect the interpersonal norms of society deserve to be treated, on an interpersonal level, equally by society.
1.14.1. Pro: People ought to be judged on how they treat others, not how they treat themselves.
1.14.1.1. Con: How people treat themselves inevitably influences how they affect and thus treat others. For example, parents can be good or bad role models.
1.14.1.1.1. Con: Obese people can absolutely be good role models otherwise; how someone deals with their health has no impact on how kind/respectful they are to others.
1.14.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.15.4.3.2.
1.14.1.2. Pro: Those judging are more affected by how people treat each other than how they treat themselves.
1.14.2. Con: -> See 1.12.2.
1.14.3. Con: Social norms exist well and truly beyond the interpersonal, and extend to concerns about public health.
1.14.3.1. Pro: For example, smokers are both treated with disdain by many, and have their liberty infringed upon by the state \(e.g. prohibitions on smoking in many public areas\).
1.14.3.1.1. Con: Second-hand-smoke affects the health of all those around a smoker. There is no parallel with obesity.
1.14.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.11.1.
1.14.3.1.3. Con: Smokers are not shamed to the degree that the obese are.
1.14.4. Pro: Society is better off when our default interaction is respect for other humans.
1.14.4.1. Con: Much of society's wealth is based on disrespect for others, such as production facilities for [iPhones](https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/8826-Dying-for-an-iPhone-the-lives-of-Chinese-workers) or [shoes](http://changeyourshoes-bg.org/overview/). These consumption opportunities would diminish.
1.14.4.2. Pro: People are happier when they are treated with respect.
1.14.4.3. Pro: If our default status is respect for others, we are more likely to support policies that benefit others, because we would inherently value others' lives more.
1.14.4.4. Pro: If people know that they will be treated with respect, they are more likely to engage productively in civil society.
1.14.5. Pro: It is [immoral](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=939000) to base our treatment of others on physical characteristics \(e.g. racism\).
1.14.5.1. Con: Racism is horrible because race is an involuntary characterist. For the majority of cases, obesity is not an involuntary characteristic.
1.14.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.14.6. Con: This is hardly a maxim our society lives up to and it would be hypocritical to put this forward with regard to obese people only.
1.14.6.1. Pro: Men and women are treated differently even though both respect the same interpersonal norms.
1.14.6.1.1. Con: They shouldn't be.
1.14.6.2. Pro: The elderly are treated differently than the bulk of the working class.
1.14.6.3. Pro: Teenagers are not allowed to vote.
1.14.6.4. Con: Improvements in how society treats people have to start somewhere.
1.15. Pro: -> See 1.1.15.2.1.6.
1.16. Pro: Treating obesity as unacceptable works as a deterrent.
1.16.1. Con: It has been unacceptable to be obese for generations, and yet obesity levels have increased. Therefore the assertion that it "works" as a deterrent is incorrect.
1.16.1.1. Con: Saying that it works isn’t the same thing as saying it’s perfect.
1.16.2. Con: This is not borne out by experience. And those who manage to conform to "acceptable" weight or size may do so by developing eating disorders. Such disorders can be more harmful to the body than obesity.
1.16.3. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.16.4. Pro: Publicly shaming people as a tool for deterrence is used by courts, for example in the case of [Shawn Gementera](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/17/AR2005091700064.html), who was ordered to stand outside a post office wearing a sign reading "I stole mail. This is my punishment."
1.16.5. Pro: There is a pressure to conform to the standard. The [Asch conformity experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments), for example, illustrate how majority views are a pressure many people comply with.
1.16.5.1. Con: The Asch conformity experiments asked for a low level of commitment to conformity \(saying one line was a different length\) and gave an immediate result. This is not comparable to the commitment it takes to lose weight and the length of of time before any results are seen.
1.16.6. Pro: Individuals are motivated to gain [acceptance](https://www.uky.edu/~drlane/teams/pavitt/ch6.htm) from others.
1.17. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.2.
1.18. Pro: -> See 1.7.5.10.
