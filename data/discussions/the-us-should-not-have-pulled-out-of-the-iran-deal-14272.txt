Discussion Title: The US Should Not Have Pulled Out of the Iran Deal.

1. The US Should Not Have Pulled Out of the Iran Deal.
1.1. Pro: Pulling out of the deal undermines internal Iranian shifts in politics by [undermining the credibility of moderates](http://www.newsweek.com/iran-election-how-donald-trump-undermining-moderates-hardliners-610224) such as Rouhani while strengthening the influence of hardliners.
1.1.1. Pro: [Kayhan](https://en.radiofarda.com/a/iran-press-pessimistic-nuclear-deal-jcpoa/29214815.html), a hardline Iranian newspaper whose editor is directly appointed by Supreme Leader Khamenei, has been aggressively attacking the Rouhani administration and the JCPOA.
1.1.2. Pro: A more hardline government is [likely to](http://carnegie.ru/2016/08/18/russia-and-iran-historic-mistrust-and-contemporary-partnership-pub-64365) [align itself](https://en.radiofarda.com/a/iran-politician-boroujerdi-strengthen-ties-russia-china/29121677.html) with Russia, who want to establish a permanent military presence in the country, against the West.
1.1.2.1. Con: Russia has [vocally supported](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/04/23/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-trump-macron-intl/index.html) the nuclear deal and campaigned against the U.S. withdrawal from it, which suggests that it does not perceive that withdrawal as an opportunity to secure a military foothold in Iran.
1.1.2.2. Con: Russian-Iranian interactions in Syria, where Russia has [cooperated](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/05/29/russia-israel-agree-deal-hold-back-iranian-militias-assad-prepares/) with Iran's mortal enemy Israel to the detriment of Iranian interests, demonstrate the deeply mistrustful nature of their relations. The development of a Russian military presence in Iran is unlikely in light of this fraught relationship.
1.1.3. Con: Rouhani has [stated](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-rouhani/rouhani-says-iran-may-remain-part-of-nuclear-accord-idUSKCN1IE0BY) that: “If the remaining five countries continue to abide by the agreement, Iran will remain in the deal despite the will of America”. This will allow him to save face.
1.1.3.1. Con: Iranian hardliners have [already started invoking](http://www.france24.com/en/20180511-anti-usa-protests-iran-trump-withdraw-nuclear-deal-zarif-rouhani) the U.S. withdrawal from the deal as evidence that the European signatories also constitute "Iran's enemies" and cannot be trusted.
1.1.4. Con: The Ayatollah Khamenei still [supports](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/his-nuclear-deal-and-economy-are-crumbling-but-dont-write-off-irans-president-yet/2018/05/11/eff2c228-53a4-11e8-a6d4-ca1d035642ce_story.html?utm_term=.aabea461ac77) Rouhani.
1.1.5. Con: Rouhani's political support is very high. As recently as April 2018, [59 percent](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/his-nuclear-deal-and-economy-are-crumbling-but-dont-write-off-irans-president-yet/2018/05/11/eff2c228-53a4-11e8-a6d4-ca1d035642ce_story.html?utm_term=.aabea461ac77) of Iranians held a favorable view of the president.
1.1.6. Con: Rouhani is a [shrewd](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/his-nuclear-deal-and-economy-are-crumbling-but-dont-write-off-irans-president-yet/2018/05/11/eff2c228-53a4-11e8-a6d4-ca1d035642ce_story.html?utm_term=.aabea461ac77) political operator who has been a government insider for years. His close connections to the ruling clerics will continue to allow him to hold on to power.
1.1.6.1. Con: Rouhani's most direct challenges have originated [from within](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/09/conservative-cleric-ebrahim-raisi-enters-irans-presidential-race) Iran's clerical class. His hold on power is by no means guaranteed by his connections to them.
1.1.7. Pro: Rouhani has staked his [political reputation](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-rouhani/irans-rouhani-seen-as-lame-duck-after-trump-ditches-deal-idUSKBN1IA287) on the success of the deal.
1.1.8. Pro: The [Revolutionary Guards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Revolutionary_Guard_Corps) and their hardline allies have always [opposed](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/04/iran-nuclear-deal-bolton-trump-regime-change/558785/) the deal and will use the opportunity to claim they were correct, and to denounce moderate voices that supported the deal.
1.2. Con: Iran deceived the international community about the deal prior to its implementation.
1.2.1. Pro: Negotiations are dependent upon mutual good faith, and require full information. Any concessions or decisions made on incomplete information are illegitimate.
1.2.2. Pro: The Iran deal was contingent on the International Atomic Energy Agency \(IAEA\) clearing Iran of military nuclear activity. However, Iran [concealed](https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/pm-expected-to-reveal-how-iran-cheated-world-on-nuke-program-1.6045300) 55,000 pages of documents and 183 CDs from the IAEA which detailed plans to create nuclear warheads. Had this fact been exposed prior to the agreement, the deal would not have taken place.
1.2.2.1. Con: The [information](https://www.vox.com/world/2018/4/30/17303576/netanyahu-iran-deal-speech-amad) 'revealed' in the press conference by Netanyahu was already well known to signatories and did not concern behaviour after the deal was struck. It would not have prevented the deal.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: The purpose of Netanyahu's press conference was to reveal the fact that that deal was based upon many lies: The Iranians said they weren't creating nuclear weapon, they were just trying to create civil energy source. The [information](https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/pm-expected-to-reveal-how-iran-cheated-world-on-nuke-program-1.6045300) showed they were lying - hence the grounds for making a deal was not valid. Netanyahu did not state that the Iranians were breaking the deal - he showed strong base to the claim - the agreement was based on lies. It should have prevented the deal.
1.2.3. Con: The absence of a full Iranian confession regarding its past activities is [not](https://www.brookings.edu/research/debating-the-iran-nuclear-deal-a-former-american-negotiator-outlines-the-battleground-issues/) a serious obstacle to ensuring that Iran is not pursuing nuclear weapons going forward: the range of tools available under JCPOA to monitor Iran are sufficient to prevent Iranian development of nuclear weapons.
1.2.4. Con: The deal was negotiated with the assumption that the Iranians were lying anyway. The program that they concealed was [already known](https://www.vox.com/world/2018/4/30/17303576/netanyahu-iran-deal-speech-amad) to intelligence officials and the negotiators.
1.3. Con: President Trump's decision to pull the US out of the Iran Deal was in his best interests.
1.3.1. Con: Everything is not about Donald Trump. The security of the international community infinitely outweighs the political capital of his problematic political career.
1.3.2. Pro: It has strengthened Trump's relationship with Israel and Netanyahu who are [allies](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-gop-became-a-pro-israel-party/) of America, and the Republican Party in particular.
1.3.2.1. Con: Many European countries [want to continue the Iran nuclear](http://time.com/5278277/europe-iran-deal/) deal, and Trump is worsening those relationships.
1.3.3. Con: Scrapping the deal greatly helps the cause of regime change in the US.  The President now officially represents the US an an unreliable deal-maker.  His ability to remain in office will be severely weakened by his actions over this deal.
1.3.3.1. Pro: It promotes the chance of impeachment, as it helps alienate some in Congress who had previously hitched their wagon to his.
1.3.4. Pro: Pulling out of the Iran Deal appeals to Trump's base of voters.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Pulling out of the Iran Deal shows that Trump is willing to stand up to Iran, widely viewed in [right-wing circles](https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/05/iran-deal-withdrawal-president-trump-good-move/) as an enemy of America.
1.3.4.1.1. Con: The [majority](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/08/politics/poll-iran-agreement/index.html) of US citizens did not support pulling out of the deal. Trump needs to win not just his base Republican voters \(who will vote for him anyway\), but also undecided voters and some Democrats. Pulling out hurt his chances of doing so.
1.3.4.1.1.1. Pro: The [vast majority](http://www.people-press.org/2016/07/07/4-top-voting-issues-in-2016-election/) of American voters consider foreign policy and terrorism to be very important determinants of how they vote. U.S. relations with Iran are therefore likely to be of substantial relevance to voter behaviour.
1.3.4.1.1.2. Pro: More [disapprove](http://www.people-press.org/2018/05/08/public-is-skeptical-of-the-iran-agreement-and-trumps-handling-of-the-issue/) of Trump's move \(40%\) than approve \(32%\): if anything the move is likely to motivate some voters not to vote for Trump.
1.3.4.1.1.2.1. Con: The public is a different demographic to his base. Most of those against are probably already voting against him.
1.3.4.1.1.2.2. Con: Making the Iranian regime richer is unlikely to be a successful platform for US politicians in a general election, suggesting that if his opponent takes a more pro-Iran line it will more likely help Trump than hurt him.
1.3.4.1.1.3. Con: Trump doesn't win independents and Democrats through some popularity contest. He targets their fears about one specific issue, and lies to them about it over and over until they choose to vote out of fear on the off chance that he's not lying.
1.3.4.1.1.4. Con: Trump had a democratic mandate to pull out of the deal, given Iran refused to renegotiate it. To stay in the deal unamended would have been undemocratic.
1.3.4.1.1.4.1. Con: Renegotiation is optional. Refusing to renegotiate a deal that took 20 months to complete is not only optional but rational. Reopening negotiation would have put everything that had been accomplished at risk.
1.3.4.1.1.4.1.1. Con: Very little has been accomplished, other than temporarily pausing one element of nuclear weapons development in return for lining the coffers of the revolutionary guard to the tune of billions of dollars and [removing economic pressure](https://www.vox.com/world/2018/5/8/17326650/iran-nuclear-deal-withdraw-trump-speech-goldberg-interview)..
1.3.4.1.1.4.2. Pro: Elected officials following through on promises made during election campaigns restores faith in democracy.
1.3.4.1.1.4.3. Con: Trump did [not](https://www.thenation.com/article/say-it-again-donald-trump-did-not-win-the-popular-vote/) win the popular vote in the 2016 election. This means he has either a weak mandate or no mandate. Having more voters vote for another candidate is a sign that leaders should not make bold decisions that significantly depart from the status quo with only the justification of the will of the people being behind them.
1.3.4.1.1.4.3.1. Con: This is an attempt to change the long established rules of US presidential elections after the fact, and has no bearing on Trump's mandate.
1.3.4.1.1.4.3.2. Con: If the popular vote had any significance in the result of a US presidential election, which is does not, then Trump would have campaigned differently as low population states and swing states would have less significance.  Similarly, voters would have voted differently as voters in clear red or blue states would have more motivation to vote. Therefore the popular vote argument is exceptionally weak.
1.3.4.1.1.4.3.3. Con: [Over 10% of US presidents won despite having lost the popular vote](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_elections_in_which_the_winner_lost_the_popular_vote), showing this is a perfectly anticipated result that does not affect legitimacy or mandate in any way.
1.3.4.1.1.4.3.4. Con: One of the aims of the electoral college is to ensure that all states are represented fairly, even if they have small populations. This ensures that successful presidential campaigns have to appeal to diverse groups across the country. Regional candidates like Hillary who were very popular in a few populous areas are therefore specifically disadvantaged under the rules, as the founding fathers intended.
1.3.4.1.1.4.4. Con: Politicians have a duty to carry out the best policies while in office, regardless of what they said during their campaign.
1.3.4.1.1.4.5. Con: The 2016 presidential election was not a referendum on a single issue. Voters voted for Donald Trump for many different reasons.
1.3.4.2. Pro: [53%](http://www.people-press.org/2018/05/08/public-is-skeptical-of-the-iran-agreement-and-trumps-handling-of-the-issue/) of Republican leaning voters opposed the deal, as opposed to 22% who support it.
1.3.4.3. Pro: Pulling out supports the impression he frequently conveys to his base that he's deadly serious about [America First](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_First_\(policy\)). They seem to [approve](http://news.gallup.com/poll/228149/trump-rated-best-terrorism-economy-better-taxes.aspx).
1.3.4.3.1. Pro: It shows his commitment to [America First](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_First_\(policy\)) in that he's prepared to [alienate most of the US's allies](https://buff.ly/2LyRzYx), undermine the credibility of America and thus risk any possibility of peace with North Korea, and pander to the desires of Israeli leadership to have an excuse to bomb Iran into the Stone Age.
1.3.4.3.1.1. Pro: From the N Korea US summit N Korea gave less towards denuclearization than they had given before. They appear to be continuing their [nuclear program](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/27/north-korea-nuclear-reactor-upgrades-summit-pledges).
1.3.4.3.2. Con: The Gallup poll evidence is inconclusive and otherwise weak as a source.
1.3.4.3.2.1. Pro: The relevance of the Gallup source is slightly unclear. The source never says something like "Republicans support him because of his America First position in foreign affairs." He may just have moderately high support for his foreign affairs policies because he is considered a "Republican."
1.3.4.3.2.2. Pro: The source actually seems to undermine the original claim; at best the source does not suggest much: 
1. It says that his net approval for foreign affairs is -20%. 
2. Assuming the focus is just on Republican support, their approval of foreign affairs is lower than multiple other ratings, so it could just as easily be that more Republicans dislike his foreign affairs policies than if he had a non America First stance.
1.3.4.4. Con: -> See 1.3.4.1.1.
1.3.4.5. Pro: Pulling out of the Iran deal is likely to lead to a [rise](http://time.com/5269906/iran-nuclear-deal-donald-trump-oil/) in oil prices, which helps [Republicans](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/03/oil-and-gas-industry-has-pumped-millions-into-republican-campaigns).
1.3.4.5.1. Pro: Oil companies are [frequent donors](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/03/oil-and-gas-industry-has-pumped-millions-into-republican-campaigns) to the Republican party.
1.3.4.6. Pro: Withdrawing from the Iran deal destroys a key peace of Obama's [legacy](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/11/donald-trump-barack-obama-legacy), something which Trump's base supports.
1.3.4.7. Con: Trump's base is [likely](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41028733) to support Trump in any action he takes.
1.3.4.7.1. Pro: Trump's base was just as \(if not more\) [supportive](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/06/11/trump-could-get-political-boost-north-korea-summit-pollsters-say/691992002/) of his agreement with North Korea as they were with his agreement with Iran. These are seemingly contradictory positions.
1.3.4.7.1.1. Con: Trump's agreement with Kim Jong Un concerns a completely different situation than the Iran deal.
1.3.4.7.1.1.1. Pro: The US has a greater stake in peace with North Korea than with Iran due to the presence of almost [thirty thousand US troops](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-43971847) in South Korea who are directly endangered by the DPRK's nuclear programme. North Korea, knowing this, will see that the US is more likely to adhere to this deal than with the Iranian one.
1.3.4.7.1.1.2. Pro: North Korea's hand has been forced regarding nuclear disarmament due to the [collapse of its primary testing site](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/26/north-korea-nuclear-test-site-collapse-may-be-out-of-action-china). It is therefore likely to accept a peace and disarmament deal even if it has some doubts about US credibility because it has little other option.
1.3.4.7.1.1.2.1. Con: With the resources of the entire dictatorship at his disposal, it's well within Kim Jung Un's capability to rectify the testing setback, so negotiation may only be a ploy to gain time.
1.3.4.7.1.1.3. Pro: The outbreak of nuclear war on the Korean peninsula or in East Asia more generally could endanger [millions of lives](https://www.38north.org/2017/10/mzagurek100417/), and reducing the risk of such a conflict should be a key US priority.
1.3.4.7.1.1.4. Con: Both nations have been working toward nuclear weapons.
1.3.4.7.1.1.5. Con: Both nations trade with nations other than the US, making unilateral sanctions ineffective.
1.3.4.7.1.1.6. Con: Both nations support [proxy wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_proxy_wars).
1.3.4.7.1.1.6.1. Pro: North Korea is also involved in [several](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/samuel-ramani/north-koreas-balancing-ac_b_7995688.html?guccounter=1) Middle East conflicts.
1.3.4.7.1.1.7. Con: Both nations have been developing intercontinental ballistic missiles.
1.3.4.7.1.1.8. Con: Both nations have a nemesis nearby that is an ally of the US.
1.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.1.1.4.
1.4. Con: Pulling out of the deal allows for the negotiation of better terms.
1.4.1. Con: Trump is unlikely to be able to form another deal because he won't have the support of other countries who are required to make sanctions a real threat as he has aggravated and alienated those countries by breaking this agreement.
1.4.1.1. Pro: The other countries who took part have no reason to believe Trump would hold to a replacement agreement as he's substantially lost credibility, to the point where even GOP members of Congress and a lot of the rest of "Washington" pretty much [ignore](https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2017/0802/Why-Congress-is-ignoring-Trump) everything he says.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Leaders of those nations who allied with the US on this know that it would be in Trump's own interests for him to use discussion of a replacement agreement for a few photo ops to appeal to undecideds and then accuse the other countries of stuff and pull out to appease his base again. So those leaders must consider that it's possibly not in the best interest of relations with the US to turn up, and that it may be easier to get Iran to comply by avoiding that photo op.
1.4.1.3. Pro: Unlike Obama, who helped create the deal, Trump has no interest in international stability. He thinks that world politics is about "winning" by losing least. There's no way that's slipped by the other leaders, so [there's no way they'd trust him](https://www.vox.com/world/2018/5/9/17335308/trump-decertify-iran-nuclear-deal-europe-sanction). Nor is it likely he would be able to [strike or accept a deal with Iran that Iran could accept](https://www.jpost.com/Breaking-News/Iranian-foreign-minister-Trumps-demands-on-nuclear-deal-are-unacceptable-552945), because for it to appeal to him they'd have to lose too much.
1.4.1.4. Pro: The agreement was the result of a perfect storm, the confluence of factors of international politics that are unlikely to come together again in any of our lifetimes.
1.4.2. Pro: Playing hardball will push Iran in a better direction.
1.4.2.1. Con: The scrapping of the deal will damage the economy and undermine Rouhani's credibility, empowering his [more hardline opponents](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-39984066) who are less likely to negotiate.
1.4.2.2. Pro: The sanctions relief had a [major effect](http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/iran/publication/economic-outlook-april-2017) in boosting GDP growth in a [formerly struggling economy](https://www.thebalance.com/iran-s-economy-impact-of-nuclear-deal-and-sanctions-3306349). The threat of the return of this economic situation will force Iran to the negotiating table.
1.4.2.2.1. Con: Unilateral sanctions don't have the same bite as the multilateral sanctions that were in place when the deal was agreed.
1.4.2.2.1.1. Pro: The EU, which opposes the US withdrawal from the deal, has [announced its intention](http://www.dw.com/en/eu-to-reactivate-blocking-statute-against-us-sanctions-on-iran-for-european-firms/a-43826992) to implement a ban on European companies from complying with unilateral US sanctions on Iran, thus actively undermining US attempts to sanction Iran in the absence of international support.
1.4.3. Pro: President Rouhani campaigned on making the [economy better](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-election-rouhani-tweet/irans-rouhani-vows-to-deliver-campaign-promises-idUSKCN18G0J4). Unless he can make a new deal, he is unlikely to fulfill his campaign promise.
1.4.3.1. Con: The scrapping of the deal damages the economy and thus undermines Rouhani's credibility while empowering more hardliners who are less likely to negotiate. Thus, the US is disempowering the faction that was most likely to negotiate with the US, while empowering the one most resistant to negotiation.
1.4.4. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.
1.4.5. Con: The US still has [sanctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_sanctions_against_Iran) on Iran unrelated to their nuclear program, meaning they can influence Iranian behavior in other ways.
1.4.5.1. Con: Iran is a key belligerent in the Syrian Civil War and [close ally](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/syria-and-iran-whats-behind-the-enduring-alliance/) of Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad. Scrapping the Iran deal makes future peace negotiations in regards to Syria much more difficult.
1.4.5.1.1. Con: Syrian peace talks have made little progress in the last several years, largely because Bashar al-Assad's government has refused to discuss a [post-conflict political transition](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/07/ends-syria-breakthrough-170715133937590.html), which is a key opposition demand. It would be unwise to base policy toward Iran on the hope of influencing a set of talks in which no real progress has been made since the nuclear deal was implemented.
1.4.5.2. Con: These sanctions, when compared to the sanctions which were [removed](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-15983302) following the JCPOA's implementation, are [comparatively small](https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/sm0125.aspx).
1.4.6. Pro: Iran [refused 8 requests from Trump](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/iran-says-trump-sought-meeting-with-president-8-times-at-un-last-year/ar-AAAhBhL?li=BBnbcA1)to meet with Rouhani, indicating they are not serious about negotiations and so should be financially isolated.
1.4.7. Con: If the US pulls out of the deal then countries whose interest often oppose US interests \(e.g. China or Russia\) will have less incentive to be a part of, let alone actually abide by, the next deal.
1.4.8. Con: Given the Iranian [reaction](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/trump-iran-nuclear-deal-parliament-burn-us-american-flag-death-a8342376.html) to the American withdrawal, it would be humiliating for them to agree to re-enter negotiations.
1.4.8.1. Con: These reactions show that they were never interested in any kind of peace, for if they were they would have done whatever it took to ensure all economic sanctions were lifted.  Instead, they have continually expanded their proxy wars through terrorist organizations around the world.
1.4.9. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.2.
1.5. Pro: Iran is complying with the deal.
1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.
1.5.2. Con: The deal contained insufficient regulatory measures to ensure compliance.
1.5.2.1. Pro: The IAEA does not regularly inspect [military sites](http://isis-online.org/isis-reports/detail/analysis-of-the-iaeas-sixth-iran-nuclear-deal-report-a-return-to-more-limit), significantly harming its ability to determine if Iran is in compliance with several elements of the deal.
1.5.2.1.1. Con: Iran cannot deny IAEA inspectors access to any site for more than 24 days, which is not enough time to [hide evidence](https://www.brookings.edu/research/debating-the-iran-nuclear-deal-a-former-american-negotiator-outlines-the-battleground-issues/) of covert production facilities, such as conversion and enrichment plants or centrifuge manufacturing workshops, or other relatively large objects, such as a high-explosive chamber. Moreover, sophisticated environmental sampling technologies would have a good chance of detecting microscopic traces of covert activity anyways.
1.5.2.2. Con: On the contrary, IAEA inspectors have daily access to Iranian nuclear facilities, plus equipment continuously monitoring the level of enrichment being achieved by Iran’s centrifuges. That would [detect](https://theconversation.com/iran-nuclear-deal-how-to-ensure-compliance-53485) any switch from producing reactor fuel to weapons fuel. The IAEA also uses tamper-indicating seals and surveillance systems to verify that equipment is not being removed or altered when inspectors are away.
1.5.2.3. Con: The deal also strictly limits the numbers and types of centrifuges Iran can have, which slows down its ability to enrich uranium. If Iran decided to break the deal and started using all its known centrifuges to produce weapons-usable nuclear fuel, it would take [roughly 12 months](https://theconversation.com/iran-nuclear-deal-how-to-ensure-compliance-53485) for the centrifuges to produce enough fuel for one weapon, which is more than enough time for other countries to stop Iran.
1.5.2.4. Con: It is unlikely that Iran can create weapons-grade uranium at a clandestine facility; a past attempt at a secret enrichment plant was [detected](http://www.isis-online.org/isis-reports/detail/iran-building-nuclear-fuel-cycle-facilities-international-transparency-need/8) by Western intelligence agencies well before it could become fully operational.
1.5.3. Pro: Many key members of the American intelligence community [oppose](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-intelligence/trumps-iran-move-reminds-some-of-run-up-to-iraq-war-idUSKBN1IB0HD) this move, suggesting that they believe Iran was complying.
1.5.4. Con: Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu [claims](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/30/middleeast/netanyahu-iran-nuclear-program/index.html) that Iran continues to pursue a nuclear weapons program in secret.
1.5.4.1. Con: While the files Netanyahu obtained substantiated his claims that Iran had pursued a nuclear weapons program prior to the agreement, [EU leaders](https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahus-iran-nuke-claims-fail-to-convince-deal-backers/) and an [ex-Mossad](https://www.timesofisrael.com/ex-mossad-chief-says-netanyahus-show-on-iran-had-nothing-new/) chief have noted that these files provide no evidence that Iran is not currently complying with the deal.
1.5.4.2. Con: The same Netanyahu that in Sept 2002 told US Congress that there was “[no question whatsoever](https://www.vox.com/2015/2/26/8114221/netanyahu-iraq-2002)” that Saddam Hussein was developing nuclear weapons. He also said: “I guarantee you” that toppling Saddam would have “enormous positive reverberations on the region.” Both predictions have turned out to be blatantly untrue.
1.5.5. Con: Iran [continues](https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/23/middleeast/iran-ballistic-missile-test/index.html) to test ballistic missiles which are theoretically capable of carrying a nuclear warhead.
1.5.5.1. Con: The wording of the UNSC resolution endorsing the Iran deal ["calls upon"](https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/02/03/513229839/did-irans-ballistic-missile-test-violate-a-u-n-resolution) Iran to refrain from such tests, but does not outright prohibit them. This is because Iran claims these missiles are for conventional use only, these tests do not technically violate the deal.
1.5.5.1.1. Con: The tests are in bad faith, and violate the spirit of the deal. These are good grounds to pull out.
1.5.5.1.1.1. Con: We cannot ban countries from development parallel to nuclear weapons. They have to be able to work on a space program and conventional weaponry.
1.5.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: It's Iran's right to develop conventional weapons that as a deterrent could be used in [self-defense](http://legal.un.org/repertory/art51.shtml).
1.5.6. Pro: The most recent [report](https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/18/03/gov-2018-7-derestricted.pdf) by the [International Atomic Energy Agency](https://www.iaea.org/), an independent international research organisation responsible for ensuring Iran is in compliance with nuclear aspects of the deal, has not found any breaches.
1.5.6.1. Con: -> See 1.5.2.1.
1.6. Pro: Pulling out of the deal hurts the relationship between Iran and the US.
1.6.1. Pro: The reaction to the US pulling out was for a US flag to be burnt inside the Iranian parliament building, the first time political observers could [remember](http://time.com/5270706/iran-lawmakers-burn-paper-us-flag-parliament/) such an action occurring inside the building itself.
1.6.1.1. Pro: This symbolises an increased hostility towards the US, meaning an increased likelihood of non-cooperation with the US or with US objectives \(e.g. being more likely to support action against Israel as they are a US ally\).
1.6.1.1.1. Con: Iranian opposition to Israel [is based on Israel being on land stolen from Palestinians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Israel_relations).
1.6.1.1.1.1. Pro: The [compensation paid to Germans](https://electronicintifada.net/content/when-israel-compensated-germans-land-palestine/12512) was tacit confirmation that Germans and thus Palestinians were stolen from.
1.6.1.2. Con: Burning a highly flammable object inside a packed building endangers many lives, and is therefore an unreasonable thing to do. This further supports the position that the Iranian regime is intrinsically unreasonable, willing to endanger lives for trivial reasons. This erodes confidence in their ability to be trusted on big issues like nuclear disarmament as well.
1.6.1.3. Con: The sort of person who walks around with a US flag, propellent and a lighter 'just in case' is not the sort of person one should want to give billions of dollars by letting them sell a black fluid that oozes out of the ground beneath their feet.
1.6.2. Con: Anti-American sentiment is massive within Iran, even when the deal was in place the US was still [viewed](http://www.cissm.umd.edu/sites/default/files/Iranian%20Attitudes%20in%20the%20Trump%20Era%20-%20012517%20-%20FINAL.pdf) as actively obstructive and that the relationship had not improved.
1.6.2.1. Con: Iran's relationship with the US, and the West more generally, is not static. It has [varied according to political events](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/11/04/strategic-anti-americanism-in-iran-from-the-hostage-crisis-to-nuclear-talks/) since the 1979 revolution, and the U.S. withdrawal from the deal is a substantial enough event to make a major difference to relations.
1.6.2.2. Con: Trump's decision to withdraw from the deal led to large-scale anti-American [street protests](http://www.france24.com/en/20180511-anti-usa-protests-iran-trump-withdraw-nuclear-deal-zarif-rouhani) in Iran, suggesting that his actions have indeed worsened relations.
1.6.3. Pro: The US has already demonstrated its lack of support of countries Iran supports through placing the US embassy in Jerusalem, which further exacerbates tension.
1.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.2.
1.6.5. Con: The US [does not want](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/05/trump-iran-jcpoa/560759/) to have good relations with Iran, rather, they want to punish the regime.
1.7. Pro: Pulling out of the deal allows Iran to obtain nuclear weapons much earlier than they would otherwise have been able to.
1.7.1. Con: Considering that the EU, China and Russia are still important actors in the agreement, Iran might be deterred to actively relaunch their nuclear programme.
1.7.1.1. Con: Since the US pulled out, Iran has noted publicly that it will consider options, but [order](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/08/europe/iran-deal-world-leaders-react/index.html) its "atomic industry organization to be prepared to start our industrial enrichment without limitations." The US pulling out has returned enrichment as an option for Iran.
1.7.2. Pro: If Iran decides to resume its nuclear weapons program, the [likelihood of war](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/05/11/how-trumps-iran-deal-decision-may-lead-to-war/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.f5b43c307505) increases dramatically.
1.7.2.1. Pro: The US National Security Adviser is [John Bolton](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/23/john-bolton-hawk-iran-war-national-security-adviser), someone who is aggressive towards Iran and has previously advocated for bombing Iran to stop them from pursuing a nuclear weapon.
1.7.2.1.1. Pro: Bolton has pursued regime change in Iran for years, openly supporting the [MEK](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/world/middleeast/john-bolton-regime-change-iran.html), an Iranian dissident group. As an avowed enemy of the current regime, he is likely to take an extremely hostile stance towards it.
1.7.2.2. Con: Iran, like the DPRK, most likely views their nuclear arsenal as an insurance policy against US and coalition invasion. The Iranian administration has probably witnessed and learned from what happened to regimes that voluntarily gave up their nuclear programme, e.g. Libya, Syria. The chances of Iran going on the offensive, however, are slim as they are fully aware that Western intervention would be devastating to them. \([vox.com](https://www.vox.com/2015/2/25/8101383/iran-nuclear-reasons)\)
1.7.2.3. Con: Rouhani has [explicitly pledged](http://thehill.com/policy/international/387474-rouhani-iran-will-stay-in-nuclear-deal-if-other-countries-abide-by-it) that Iran will continue to abide by the deal so long as countries other than the US continue to adhere to its terms.
1.7.3. Con: -> See 1.4.
1.7.4. Con: That is a choice for the Iranian regime to make. The deal merely kicks the can down the road, as it does not significantly degrade Iran's long term ability to develop nukes. In the meantime, it gives the Iranian regime [a lot more money](https://www.thebalance.com/iran-s-economy-impact-of-nuclear-deal-and-sanctions-3306349) with which to eventually pursue a nuclear bomb \(and a myriad of other nefarious military objectives\).
1.7.4.1. Con: It doesn't "give" Iran any money. It releases assets that were seized to put pressure on Iran to stop its nuclear weapons program.
1.7.4.1.1. Con: It gives the Iranian regime money in two ways: first, by releasing seized assets and second by allowing them to sell oil and receive investment. This amounts to [billions](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/27/donald-trump/donald-trump-iran-150-billion-and-18-billion-c/) of dollars the Iranian regime would not otherwise have.
1.7.4.2. Con: As part of the deal Iran also signed the [NPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons) \(Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\) and the [Additional Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_proliferation#Additional_Protocol) which have no expiry date.
1.7.4.2.1. Con: Iran's [announced](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/iran-plans-new-uranium-enrichment/2018/06/05/22cc5142-68fd-11e8-bf8c-f9ed2e672adf_story.html) plans to resume uranium enrichment suggest it does not take its membership of the NPT seriously.
1.7.4.2.1.1. Con: It would be irresponsible for them to not plan for all possible eventualities.
1.7.4.2.1.1.1. Con: That one of the possibilities they can see involves the use of nuclear weapons indicates it is correct to isolate them financially until they are brought to heel.
1.7.5. Pro: If Iran restarts its nuclear program in 15 years under the terms of the deal, then the US can just reimpose the sanctions that persuaded Iran to negotiate in the first place.
1.7.6. Pro: The deal offered access to Iranian facilities for monitoring — making a covert program more \(1\) difficult practically and \(2\) problematical for internal Iranian advocates for maintaining a breakout option. A breakout option gains value in case Iran wanted to exit the deal and do so with a head start on having a full capability \(before renewed international pressure in response could have much effect\).
1.7.7. Pro: If the deal remains, then Iran might resume their nuclear program in [10-15 years](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-makovsky-iran-commentary/commentary-its-time-for-trump-to-pull-out-of-the-iran-deal-idUSKBN1HH2HD). If the US pulls out, Iran could resume their program immediately.
1.7.7.1. Pro: If the so-called "sunset clauses" were a concern, the US would have been better served by opening negotiations on extending the agreement's limitations on Iranian nuclear production indefinitely.
1.7.7.2. Pro: Many safeguards [last longer](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iran/2017-10-03/iranian-nuclear-deals-sunset-clauses) than 10-15 years under the deal, and ending the deal will mean there is no time limitation whatsoever on Iranian nuclear development.
1.7.7.3. Con: There's no obvious evidence \(as of 11/06/2018, over a month after Trump withdrew the US\) that Iran has resumed their program.
1.7.7.3.1. Pro: It seems that the combined other parties to the agreement hold [weight with Iran](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/09/europe-fights-to-keep-the-iran-nuclear-deal-intact-after-trump-pulls-out.html) or that Iran would rather use its continued compliance to demonstrate that Donald Trump's choice is a [difference between him and the other parties](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-move-against-iran-nuclear-deal-would-isolate-us-sanctions/) as much as it is between him and Iran.
1.7.7.3.2. Con: Iran is waiting upon the [outcome](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/06/eu-takes-step-protect-iran-nuclear-deal-180606135159424.html) of talks with European powers as the deal has not officially been terminated. This is not evidence that they will not continue if the deal falls through.
1.8. Con: As Obama did not ratify the agreement as a treaty through Congress, the deal was intrinsically unstable and undemocratic
1.8.1. Pro: The Iran Deal was not ratified by congress, therefore making it "[unconstitutional](http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/250793-how-the-iran-deal-violates-the-constitution)".
1.8.1.1. Con: Senate Democrats [filibustered](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/10/iran-nuclear-deal-senate-day-of-decision) a Republican measure to disapprove of the deal, preventing it from passing. This is a perfectly constitutional political tactic - if it had not been, it would have been challenged in court.
1.8.1.1.1. Con: A filibuster is a legitimate tactic. But the lack of Senate disapproval doesn't change the fact that the deal was never ratified as a treaty and constituted significant Executive overreach to attempt to commit the US to a long term agreement without Congressional approval.
1.8.1.2. Con: When Trump decertified the deal under the terms of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, Congress had a [sixty day window](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/12/16767908/trump-sanctions-iran-deal-congress) in which it could have imposed sanctions on Iran, effectively ending the deal. The fact it did not do so and instead waited for Trump's final decision indicates an acceptance of the constitutionality of the deal.
1.8.1.3. Con: Courts have not struck down the Iran Deal, suggesting that the judiciary does not believe this to be true.
1.8.1.3.1. Con: Just because it is not an explicit violation of the Constitution doesn't mean that it doesn't contradict the spirit of the Constitution that states that while the President has significant leeway on foreign policy decisions, long term commitments \(like the Iran deal\) must be approved by a super majority of the Senate
1.8.1.4. Pro: The executive agreement that the Obama administration used to seal the Iran Deal could be seen as an [overreach of power](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/09/11/iran_deal_and_executive_power_a_dangerous_precedent.html) by the Executive Branch. Ratification of a treaty by Congress would have ensured a healthy separation of power.
1.8.1.4.1. Con: The Obama administration, via John Kerry, characterised the Iran Agreement [as legally non-binding](https://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/state-department-iran-deal-nonbinding-115978). The deal therefore does not represent an expanded precedent for the binding signature of international agreements by the President alone.
1.8.1.4.2. Con: The US Supreme Court has [repeatedly ruled](https://www.britannica.com/topic/executive-agreement) that executive agreements signed by Presidents with foreign countries have the same legal status as treaties. The Iran Deal is one of many such agreements, which have been repeatedly found constitutional.
1.8.1.5. Con: The Iran deal is not a bilateral deal between Washington and Tehran, or a multilateral deal which would also require Congressional approval. It is instead a [United Nations Security Council Resolution](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/08/opinion/false-assumptions-about-the-iran-nuclear-deal.html) which the Obama administration did not need congressional approval to sign on to.
1.8.2. Pro: Even if it was within his power, without Congressional approval, the Obama administration made the deal as an unstable [political commitment](https://www.lawfareblog.com/trump-administration-reaps-what-obama-administration-sowed-iran-deal) rather than a binding legal obligation.
1.8.2.1. Pro: The US should not enter into international agreements without some level of domestic congressional consensus, otherwise terms of those agreements \(such as lifting of sanctions\) can easily be overridden.
1.8.2.2. Con: It doesn't matter how the Obama administration made the deal so long as it is a good deal for the United States.
1.8.3. Con: The fact that Congressional Republicans did not like Obama's deal does not make it a bad deal in itself.
1.8.3.1. Con: [Congressional Democrats](http://www.politifact.com/new-york/statements/2018/may/24/donald-trump/schumer-once-opposed-iran-nuclear-deal-he-now-supp/) also did not like Obama's deal. The deal is a bad one on its merits and not because there was bipartisan opposition to it, but the bipartisan opposition is certainly illustrative.
1.9. Con: The leader of Iran, Ayatollah Khomeini, is [batshit crazy](https://www.algemeiner.com/2018/07/16/irans-supreme-leader-khamenei-celebrates-birthday-with-genocidal-message-for-israel/) and  called for the destruction of Israel on the occasion of his 79th birthday.
1.10. Con: So long as the deal remains in place, it interferes with any possible attempt at regime change.
1.10.1. Con: Regime change would not be in the US best interests.
1.10.1.1. Pro: Regime change that comes from the pressure from US sanctions will result in an increasingly anti-American foreign policy.
1.10.1.1.1. Pro: There is a [clear history](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24316661) of US-backed regime change in Iran having the opposite of its desired effect by leading to the overthrow of the new regime and an aggressive re-assertion of anti-American feeling.
1.10.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.
1.10.1.3. Pro: U.S.-sponsored [regime change](http://foreignpolicy.com/2018/05/08/the-art-of-the-regime-change/) in Iraq and Libya led to a civil war, a brutal insurgency, and the rise of the Islamic State and other terrorist groups. The United States has also intervened repeatedly in places including Somalia, Yemen, Afghanistan, and Syria in recent years, and all it reaped was additional instability and fertile ground for terrorists. There is no guarantee that an externally induced regime change in Iran will lead to any positive results.
1.10.1.4. Pro: It is [not at all clear](http://www.newsweek.com/iran-protests-who-are-opposition-and-who-will-rule-if-regime-falls-772045) who the opposition currently is to the Iranian regime, and who would rule were the regime to fall. Given that, a failure of the current regime is likely to result in an unstable power grab which will likely result in a completely unpredictable government. That in no way benefits the interests of the US.
1.10.1.4.1. Pro: John Bolton, National Security Advisor to Trump, supports Mujahedin-e Khalq \(MEK\) as a potential replacement of the current regime, except MEK is [widely regarded](https://www.ft.com/content/c6ace172-33f2-11e8-a3ae-fd3fd4564aa6) as a terrorist group by Iranians and has no domestic support.
1.10.1.5. Con: The current regime is actively supporting the terrorist organizations the US and its allies are fighting in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, and Israel. Changing the regime, with clear consequences for continued aggression towards the US and its allies, will only slow or stop terrorist activities, a net positive.
1.10.1.5.1. Con: This Iranian regime was one of the most decisive actors that led to the [downfall](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/this-iran-backed-militia-helped-save-iraq-from-isis-now-washington-wants-them-to-disband) of ISIS, a clear objective for US foreign policy.
1.10.1.5.1.1. Con: Iran and Hezbollah did help the effort against ISIS by partially funding/training the [PMU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Mobilization_Forces). However, there is still a proxy war with coalition forces and the Iranian leaders are considered terrorists by the US. Iran and Hezbollah increasing their strength and effectiveness, which they continue to use against allied forces, is not a good thing. Just because the two countries had similar goals for a short period of time doesn't mean one country is good for another as a whole.
1.10.1.5.2. Con: Attempting to oust the regime by reneging on the deal increases its incentive to support violent groups in other countries in a bid to counteract hostile US influence in the Middle East.
1.10.1.5.2.1. Pro: Iran's incentive to support violent groups increases when it feels the need to counteract threats to its regional security. For example, it [substantially increased](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/09/saudi-arabia-iran-great-game-ye-201492984846324440.html) its support to the Houthis in Yemen after Saudi Arabia became involved in conflict.
1.10.1.5.2.1.1. Con: The nuclear deal did not help the US contain Iranian proxy groups or prevent Iran from supporting them.
1.10.1.5.2.1.1.1. Con: The deal was narrowly-tailored to Iran's nuclear program; it was never intended to address Iran's regional actions.
1.10.1.5.2.1.1.2. Pro: Iran [sends](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-iran-houthis/exclusive-iran-steps-up-support-for-houthis-in-yemens-war-sources-idUSKBN16S22R) advanced weapons and military advisers to Yemen’s rebel Houthi movement.
1.10.1.5.2.1.1.3. Pro: Iran is believed by some analysts to [fund](http://english.alarabiya.net/en/perspective/features/2018/04/08/ANALYSIS-Funding-Hezbollah-terror-paid-for-by-depriving-its-struggling-citizens.html) Hezbollah to the tune of $300 million a year, although many now believe the sum is more like $1 billion.
1.10.2. Con: The US is hypocritical in demanding regime change in Iran while it allies itself with autocratic regimes such as Saudi Arabia. A hypocritical demand to change the regime in Iran should not be used as an excuse to get out of a deal that Trump otherwise does not like.
1.10.3. Con: The popularity of the Iranian conservative regime was [plummeting](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2004/02/26/big-deal-in-iran/) at the start of the 21st century. It was only when Bush accused Iran as being part of the '[axis of evil](https://rusi.org/publication/newsbrief/dealing-iran)' that Iranian conservatives won elections, [cancelling](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40209792?newaccount=true&read-now=1&seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) all the progress made by reformists. Trump, by pursuing a similar strategy, is only helping the hardliners in Iran.
1.10.4. Pro: The fact that the deal was struck show that [sanctions worked](https://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-iran-deal-is-a-victory-for-reason-and-economic-sanctions), as Iran gave up its nuclear ambitions. Those same sanctions can be used to pursue the more ambitious objective of accepting a democratic means of government.
1.10.4.1. Con: [Various](https://www.timesofisrael.com/mossad-chief-100-percent-certain-iran-still-seeks-nuclear-bomb/) [sources](https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/214677) [argue](http://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/385883-obamas-iran-nuclear-deal-is-dead) that Iran likely has not "given up" its nuclear ambitions; the deal certainly does not prove that they are planning to abandon the nuclear program.
1.10.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.7.7.2.
1.10.4.1.2. Con: Regardless of their intent when they started the deal-making process, by [removing centrifuges](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-idUSKBN1501R5) and [exporting nuclear materials](https://www.vox.com/2015/7/17/8989147/iran-nuclear-deal-myths) they didn't pause their nuclear program, they rolled it back so perhaps their intent changed during the long negotiations or perhaps their intent was always stronger commitment to denuclearization than the parent suggests.
1.10.4.1.2.1. Con: Removing centrifuges and exporting nuclear materials does not necessarily mean that they have given up their nuclear ambitions; there are plenty of other possible explanations, including that they simply want to give off the appearance of good intentions.
1.10.4.1.3. Pro: For example, even assuming that they are complying with the agreement, it's a reasonable possibility that they may just be planning to pause/roll back their nuclear program until the sunset of the deal or until pressures/suspicions have eased, at which point they may resume production.
1.10.4.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.7.4.2.
1.10.4.2. Con: The reason sanctions \(might have\) "worked" is because the Iranians saw negotiations as a viable route, because they hoped that the US would adhere to the agreement. Pulling out has shown that negotiating their way to peace is unlikely to work.
1.10.4.3. Con: -> See 1.4.1.4.
1.10.5. Con: Any peace deal with foreign nations is tacit support for peaceful international relations in opposition to the hard liners who have the ear of the Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei. Thus the deal supports internal regime change, if not an "attempt" at regime change, which is code for war against Iran.
1.10.6. Pro: The deal gives the impression that Iran is peaceful, possibly more peaceful than it is. Thus it makes it politically more difficult to justify going to war with Iran to kill, capture, or drive out its leaders.
1.10.7. Con: Regime change as a consequence of ending the deal would be a bad result.
1.10.7.1. Pro: The deal will disempower moderates, leading to hardliners gaining more power.
1.10.7.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.
1.10.7.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.
1.11. Pro: Pulling out of the deal would undermine American promises abroad.
1.11.1. Con: As the USA is arguably the most militarily and politically powerful nation in the world and considering that the deal was signed by a previous president, many nations would still be ready to accept agreements with America, as such deals are rarely cancelled and often very beneficial.
1.11.1.1. Con: Chancellor Merkel has been clear that Trump has [undermined](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/387067-merkel-europe-cant-count-on-us-to-protect-us-anymore) the post-WWII world order, in which Western nations protected each other, and that it would cause Europe to stand alone.
1.11.1.2. Con: This would still mean any American promise is only good for the duration of the current presidency.
1.11.1.3. Con: Many would not be enough to create the coordinated sanctions required to deal with rogue states, including replacing the deal with anything at all, let alone anything better.
1.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.11.1.1.
1.11.3. Pro: Trump is considering applying [sanctions upon European companies](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/13/us-sanctions-european-countries-iran-deal-donald-trump) that continue trading with Iran under the terms of the deal, which will likely lead to an economic confrontation.
1.11.3.1. Pro: Previous economic confrontations with the EU, such as George W. Bush's 2002 attempt to impose tariffs on European steel, have [resulted in economic damage to the US](https://www.politico.eu/article/facing-a-trade-war-europe-rediscovers-its-swagger/) which forced it to back down.
1.11.3.2. Pro: The EU has [signalled its resolve](http://www.dw.com/en/eu-to-reactivate-blocking-statute-against-us-sanctions-on-iran-for-european-firms/a-43826992) not to back down from such a confrontation, saying that it will ban European companies from complying with US sanctions on Iran.
1.11.4. Con: The U.S.'s EU allies \(i.e. France, U.K. & Germany\) oppose the action of pulling out of the agreement, but Saudi Arabia and Israel, the U.S.'s main allies in the region, approve of pulling out of the agreement.
1.11.5. Pro: Pulling out would suggest political and social indecisiveness within the USA.
1.11.5.1. Pro: Trump is seen world-wide as an anomaly when it comes to Presidents and policy. Political indecision is expected of his presidency, with policy on a number of matters changing rapidly between him and Obama's view and he himself changing his mind regularly.
1.11.5.1.1. Con: That a given character flaw has come to be expected of Trump does not mean that it no longer counts as a flaw. Presidential indecision and unreliability damage the capacity of the U.S. to make credible promises, undermining its alliances and agreements abroad.
1.11.5.2. Pro: Countries should know that an agreement signed with the US is not only valid until the next President comes to power. EU countries have maintained the same commitment as their predecessors. This is not an Obama, Hollande, or a Merkel deal: it is a deal in which the US, Germany, France, the UK, Russia, the EU and China negotiated serving a common interest: preventing nuclear proliferation in the Middle East.
1.11.6. Pro: The US will have a [harder time](https://www.cfr.org/expert-roundup/middle-east-after-iran-nuclear-deal) containing Iranian allies such as Hezbollah and the Houthis when there is a deterioration of relations.
1.11.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.5.2.1.
1.11.6.2. Con: Iran has [funded](https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/iran-spends-billions-on-proxy-wars-here-s-where-its-money-is-going-1.5630081) groups in civil wars within Gaza, Lebanon and Syria, in part with the financial gain the lifting of sanctions provided.
1.11.7. Pro: Pulling out of the deal makes a peace and nuclear disarmament agreement with North Korea less likely.
1.11.7.1. Pro: The recent opening of talks with DPRK has led to suggestions that the US might end sanctions and military threats toward the state in exchange for the dismantling of its nuclear programme. Walking away from the [extremely similar Iran deal](http://www.dw.com/en/why-the-iran-nuclear-deals-collapse-is-a-disaster-for-north-korea/a-43734409) in spite of Iranian compliance will undermine US credibility with the DPRK.
1.11.7.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.7.1.1.3.
1.11.7.1.2. Con: The DPRK will not view the US as less credible. Actions taken by the US towards different states are specific to the country in question and the DPRK can recognize this. A DPRK-US deal will be determined by the interests of each country, not what is happening elsewhere in the world.
1.11.7.1.2.1. Con: If there was any real progress at the Singapore summit then, given that the wording of the joint statement was [no improvement over previous DPRK positions](https://www.wired.com/story/north-korea-summit-denuclearize-history/), that progress clearly wasn't practical, it was personal. So the credibility of Donald Trump re international deals is obviously in play.
1.11.7.2. Con: -> See 1.3.4.7.1.1.1.
1.11.7.3. Con: -> See 1.3.4.7.1.1.2.
1.11.8. Con: Remaining in the deal sets a dangerous precedent for future Presidents to bypass Congress and make Executive Agreements binding. Leaving the deal increases the incentive for future deals to be ratified and increase their credibility.
1.11.9. Pro: [All major European](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-iran-nuclear/pressure-grows-on-trump-to-keep-iran-nuclear-deal-alive-idUKKBN1HU28T) countries are opposed to the US withdrawal from the Iran Deal. It would therefore lead to a [further deterioration](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/31/politics/european-union-trump/index.html) between the major Western powers.
1.11.10. Pro: No, The deal was agreed by the P5+1 with inspections and compliance by the IAEA. By pulling out, the US shows it cannot be trusted to broker such deals and will only embolden other nuclear aspirant nations to reach their goals outside of the NPT. The fact that the pull out was swiftly followed by further sanctions \(which are themselves an act of war\) only shows that the US is acting in its own self interest regarding foreign policy goals and not in the interests of Nuclear Non-Proliferation
1.12. Con: Iran is a rogue state that the US should not deal with.
1.12.1. Con: Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. The deal lets inspectors poke their noses into places all over Iran. If Iran can kick the inspectors out, the US loses valuable intelligence.
1.12.2. Con: The US selectively applies the term "rogue state" to countries towards which it is hostile. [Important US allies](https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-trump-is-complicit-in-israel-s-downfall-into-a-rogue-state-1.5844099) may also fit the definition of a "rogue state" in terms of their relationship with international law, but this does not lead the US to abandon them.
1.12.3. Con: Peace, or at least relative peace, is important. From the perspective of "The West" and other similarly well behaved countries, we don't make peace with our friends, we make peace with our enemies. As we're only the good guys in most ways \(no country being without its flaws\), the odds are that our enemies aren't going to be saints, so we can't just look down our nose at them and hope they'll start acting better.
1.12.4. Pro: As the world's most powerful country, the US has unique coercive abilities, meaning their actions are comparably more likely to rein in a rogue state. Thus the US should act coercively, not friendly.
1.12.4.1. Pro: The US's economic power means economic sanctions imposed by the US are very impactful.
1.12.4.1.1. Con: However, some targets, like Iran, face little chance of internal regime change and are willing to pass on the impact of sanctions to their populace. This is significantly less painful for unilateral sanctions, that by definition are only a minor inconvenience compared to multilateral sanctions that leave no destination for exports and no source for staples.
1.12.4.2. Pro: Rogue states harm their people and the people of other countries.
1.12.4.2.1. Pro: International norms exist to protect human rights and ensure peace. Rogue states, by definition, violate those norms.
1.12.4.3. Pro: Friendly engagement with a rogue state acts as a tacit endorsement of their actions.
1.12.4.3.1. Con: The U.S. has historically [engaged with other](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/dprkchron) "rogue states" existentially opposed both to it and to the international order. Engagement on issues such as arms control and nuclear proliferation does not constitute an endorsement, but does serve to limit threats to global security.
1.12.4.3.2. Pro: Political isolation \(e.g. North Korea, Apartheid South Africa\) is used to communicate that the regime's policies are anathema to the rest of the world.
1.12.4.3.3. Pro: Engaging on friendly terms with rogue states implies that they are in good standing with the international community.
1.12.4.3.3.1. Pro: Without the threat of political isolation, countries have no incentive to abide by international norms.
1.12.4.4. Con: The US is one of the few countries with the resources and military strength to implement change in other parts of the world \('the world's policeman'\). To a certain extent, it should engage with rogue states as few others have the means to do so and if it is believed to bring about positive change e.g. interfering when it was believed Iran was sponsoring terrorism in Afghanistan.
1.12.4.4.1. Pro: International organisations cannot influence the actions of another state massively as they are often unwilling to violate sovereignty.
1.12.4.4.2. Con: By the US interfering with the actions of other states to change them, the change will reflect what is in the US's strategic interests rather than what is necessarily good.
1.12.4.5. Con: Coercive behavior only serves its purpose until it achieves its objective. After that it becomes a problem itself. The US should learn to take yes for an answer and move on.
1.12.4.6. Con: There is no reason to drop the carrot just because you have a big stick. It's practical to compartmentalize discussions on different issues.
1.12.5. Con: -> See 1.12.4.4.
1.12.6. Pro: Iran funds and militarily supports a number of US-designated terrorist organizations and other paramilitary groups around the world, including [Hezbollah](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-10814698), the [Houthi rebels](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-iran-houthis/exclusive-iran-steps-up-support-for-houthis-in-yemens-war-sources-idUSKBN16S22R), [Hamas](https://www.timesofisrael.com/iran-we-still-fund-hamas-as-fighting-israel-is-our-policy/), and the [Taliban](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/jun/22/military.afghanistan?gusrc=rss&feed=uknews).
1.12.6.1. Pro: The deal contained no provision to end funding for terrorist groups, and the economic boost from the deal can be [used to fund them](https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/05/president-trump-exits-iran-deal-boost-for-global-security/).
1.12.6.1.1. Con: That the deal contained no provision to end funding for terrorist groups is evidence that the US saw fit to separate this issue from that of nuclear prevention. Prioritising the long-term prevention of a highly dangerous Iranian nuclear weapons program in order to prevent catastrophic harm is a legitimate tactical choice.
1.12.6.2. Con: US allies in the Middle East such as Saudi Arabia have also been suspected by American officials of [funding terrorist and paramilitary groups in the region](https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/factcheck-qa-is-saudi-arabia-funding-isis), including ISIS, Al-Qaeda, Al-Nusra and the Taliban. If such behaviour does not prevent the US from allying with them, nor should it lead the US to treat Iran as a rogue state.
1.12.6.3. Con: -> See 1.10.1.5.2.1.
1.12.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.11.6.2.
1.12.6.5. Pro: Through Hezbollah, Iran is heavily [involved](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2017/obama-hezbollah-drug-trafficking-investigation/) in the global cocaine trade.
1.12.7. Pro: Despite possessing some trappings of democracy, Iran [remains](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/world/middleeast/iran-presidential-election-democracy.html) a nation governed first and foremost by an unelected, theocratic, ruling class.
1.12.7.1. Pro: The [Guardian Council](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/world/middleeast/iran-presidential-election-democracy.html) is able to block candidates who do not conform to the Ayatollah's wishes.
1.12.7.2. Pro: The [Ayatollah](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/world/middleeast/iran-presidential-election-democracy.html) is constitutionally at the head of the government, and is not an elected figure.
1.12.7.3. Con: Not being a democracy does not equate to being a rogue state. The US is [allied with and actively supportive](http://uk.businessinsider.com/germany-norway-stop-selling-weapons-to-saudi-led-coalition-2018-1?r=US&IR=T) of a number of non-democratic states in the Middle East.
1.12.7.4. Con: Rouhani's election shows the [theocracy](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-election-analysis/after-rouhani-re-election-expect-hardliners-to-settle-scores-idUSKCN18G0CK) isn't as strong as the parent makes it seem.
1.12.7.4.1. Con: Rouhani may be comparatively liberal, but he was a [member](http://time.com/time-person-of-the-year-2015-runner-up-hassan-rouhani/) of Ayatollah Khamenei's inner circle, demonstrating that the clerics still have strong control over who is able to put together a power base to run.
1.12.8. Con: Choosing to not engage with a "rogue state" doesn't make the said state become less "rogue". The US has diplomatic relations with, and negotiates deals with, states that take similar actions to what Iran has done and is doing, for example Saudi Arabia.
1.12.8.1. Con: Trump isn't choosing not to engage with Iran, or other rogue states. Quite the contrary. Rather, he is choosing not to funnel money to one of if not the biggest state sponsor of terrorists.
1.12.8.1.1. Con: Far more has been [taken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_frozen_assets) from Iran, currently about 25% of [Iran's GDP](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=iran+gdp&oq=iran+gdp&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l3.2067j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), than was returned after the signing of the deal, around 7.5%, a one off not a funneling, the return of assets that were specifically frozen to pressure for a deal.
1.12.8.1.1.1. Con: The assets weren't frozen to pressure for the deal, but to restrict Iran's capability and desire to develop new nuclear weapons. The deal, with its sunset clause, does not achieve that aim.
1.12.8.1.1.1.1. Con: There was nothing to stop us negotiating to extend aspects of the deal.
1.12.8.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The US tried to do [precisely that](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-usa/iran-says-will-not-renegotiate-nuclear-deal-warns-against-changes-idUSKBN1I41CO) and Iran refused.
1.12.8.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: That was a response to Trump's bluster. There's no indication in the article that any actual diplomacy was occurring or had occurred toward supplementing the deal.
1.12.8.1.1.1.2. Con: The parent claim misrepresents the aim to constrain as if that could continue indefinitely. The aim to constrain was via a deal, because a deal would outlast the multilateral nature of the sanctions, which, when gone, was going to leave Iran under no significant constraint.
1.12.8.1.1.1.2.1. Con: The aim wasn't to constrain through any deal, no matter the terms.  There is no indication that Obama's Iran deal would have been considered sufficient by the original sanctioners, given that Obama was unable to convince his own Congress and own party that the terms of the deal were sufficient.
1.12.8.1.1.2. Con: The [ongoing money being funnelled to Iran](https://financialtribune.com/articles/energy-economy/79082/irans-oil-exports-near-1-billion-barrels-in-2017) under the deal through allowing Iran to sell oil on the open market, which amounts to billions each year, is being used to fund Iran's military.
1.12.8.1.1.2.1. Con: Once again, along similar lines to the grandparent, this is not a matter of gifting allowance to sell oil to Iran. The restriction on oil sales was part of the sanctions that, the deal having been struck, had served their specified purpose.
1.13. Pro: Pulling out of the Iran Deal would be bad for Iranian citizens.
1.13.1. Pro: Regime change has to come from within the country. This is more likely if Iran's economy is strong and the people have money in their pockets. Putting back in place the sanctions will create an excuse to blame the US for domestic problems and a distraction from governmental incompetence.
1.13.1.1. Con: -> See 1.10.1.
1.13.1.2. Con: Pulling out of the Nuclear Deal under the assumption of regime or policy change in Iran  would be a tremendous gamble on the part of the USA as there is no guarantee and no further reason for Iran to renounce their nuclear programme and existing arsenal.
1.13.1.3. Pro: Historically, regimes under siege tend to [double down](https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/.premium-trump-pushes-sanctions-to-trigger-regime-change-in-iran-it-won-t-work-1.6112479) and use sanctions as a rallying cry for national unity and anti-Western sentiment. Pursuing regime change via sanctions is unlikely to succeed.
1.13.1.3.1. Pro: Democracies have [tried and failed](https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/.premium-trump-pushes-sanctions-to-trigger-regime-change-in-iran-it-won-t-work-1.6112479) using sanctions to topple authoritarian regimes nearly 60 times between World War I and 2000.
1.13.1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.10.4.
1.13.1.4. Pro: The [purpose](https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/.premium-trump-pushes-sanctions-to-trigger-regime-change-in-iran-it-won-t-work-1.6112479) of the Iran deal was to stop Iran's nuclear ambitions for a sufficiently long period of time to allow the regime to change from within, rather than without. That strategy has now been upended by Trump.
1.13.1.5. Pro: Discontent amongst Iranians was [increasing](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/world/middleeast/iran-protests-khamenei.html) as of late, with protests on the rise and anger directed against all factions of the ruling elite. By providing Iran with a new threat, Trump has given them leverage to reunify the people against the United States and to blame any future economic woes on the renewed sanctions.
1.13.1.5.1. Pro: The nuclear deal [undermined](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/05/iran-deal-regime-change/559709/) the Iranian regime by raising public expectations that it could not meet and taking away its ability to blame others for its poor economic performance. Trump's withdrawal of the US from the deal has eliminated that concern for the regime.
1.13.2. Pro: The Iran Deal has had a [positive economic effect](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-43975498) due to the lifting of sanctions: reversing this would make life worse for ordinary Iranians.
1.13.2.1. Pro: Sanctions caused [significant humanitarian fallout](http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/10/18/the-human-costs-of-the-iran-sanctions/) in Iran, restricting citizens' access to food, medicine, and emergency disaster relief.
1.13.2.2. Pro: The GDP of Iran grew by 12.5% the year after sanctions were lifted, and was [estimated](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-43975498) to grow by 4% in 2018 before the US pulled out of the Iran deal.
1.13.2.2.1. Pro: Daily production of oil increased by 30% between December 2015, before the deal was signed, and January 2017. Production increased by an additional 3.7% in the next seven months, exceeding the peak production level before the oil sanctions \([Habibi, p. 3](https://www.brandeis.edu/crown/publications/meb/MEB115.pdf)\).
1.13.2.2.2. Pro: The US has [threatened](https://financialtribune.com/articles/economy-domestic-economy/86416/us-threatens-european-firms-with-sanctions-for-business-with) to impose sanctions on any European company that does business with Iran, dealing a severe blow to Iran's potential growth.
1.13.2.2.2.1. Pro: French oil giant Total has [suspended](https://www.investopedia.com/news/total-halts-2b-iran-project/) a $2bn project to develop Iran's giant South Pars gas field as a result of sanctions. This move, along with other companies refusing to do business with Iran, prevents the Iranian economy from growing as much it otherwise could have.
1.13.2.3. Pro: The Iranian currency, the rial, finally managed to stabilise as a result of the negotiations for the JCPOA, but started [significantly falling in value](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-43975498) once Trump started threatening to back out of the deal. It has [already](https://theconversation.com/how-the-us-withdrawal-from-the-iran-nuclear-deal-will-affect-irans-economy-96476) lost its value against the dollar by almost three times.
1.13.2.4. Con: The Iranian economy is [restricted](https://www.dnb.co.uk/perspectives/finance-credit-risk/economic-impacts-of-the-iran-nuclear-deal.html) by a challenging business environment \(the World Bank’s 2016 Doing Business Report ranks Iran 118 out of 189 countries surveyed\) and endemic corruption \(in Transparency International’s 2015 Corruptions Perception Index, Iran was ranked at 130 out of the 168 countries surveyed\). The US has no obligation to care for Iranian citizens when it's own government does not.
1.13.2.4.1. Con: Since the nuclear agreement, moderate improvements have been observed in Iran’s international ranking in several global indexes of business climate, such as the Index of Economic Freedom, the Global Competitiveness Index and the Ease of Doing Business Index \([Habibi, p. 5/6](https://www.brandeis.edu/crown/publications/meb/MEB115.pdf)\).
1.13.2.4.2. Con: Since WWII the US had adopted a policy of globalization, investing in developing countries through [Foreign Aid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_foreign_aid). The long term benefits are wide ranging, but start with trade: It requires infrastructure and trust, and you can't trade with the deceased. Each country that becomes a backwater, or loses a substantial portion of its population, stunts trade for every country, so it's counterproductive to not care.
1.13.2.5. Pro: The growth rate in the non-oil sectors of the economy, which are the main sources of jobs and income for most Iranians, was 3.3% after the deal was signed, a significant improvement on the 3.1% decline in jobs in 2015 \([Habibi, p. 3](https://www.brandeis.edu/crown/publications/meb/MEB115.pdf)\).
1.13.2.5.1. Pro: Household budgets, after declining for seven years, finally [increased](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-43975498) after 2015.
1.13.2.5.2. Pro: The International Monetary Fund \(IMF\) [estimated](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/impact-iran-nuclear-agreement) the country’s non-oil growth in 2017 reached 4 percent.
1.13.2.5.2.1. Pro: Iran's non-oil exports [grew](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-43975498) by $5 billion after the nuclear agreement was signed, despite drought conditions having a detrimental impact on Iran's agricultural sector.
1.13.2.6. Con: The widespread protests in Iran at the start of 2018 were a result of [unemployment, inflation and the looting of national wealth](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/opinion/iran-protests-inequality.html): Iranians do not believe the economic promises made to them after the nuclear deal was signed have been delivered to them.
1.13.2.7. Con: The economic benefits of the nuclear agreement, such as larger volumes of imports and the reestablishment of global trade and investment links, have benefited Tehran and other large industrial cities, because of the larger concentration of industrial and commercial activities in these regions, while per capita household expenditures have decreased in rural Iran. The limited benefits of the deal do not help rural Iranians at all \([Habibi, p. 6](https://www.brandeis.edu/crown/publications/meb/MEB115.pdf)\).
1.13.2.8. Con: The economic benefits of the Iran deal rarely end up in the pockets of the ordinary Iranian; rather, they just help making the Iranian political and military elite richer.
1.13.2.8.1. Pro: Despite sanctions being lifted, President Rouhani’s proposed 2018–19 fiscal budget calls for a substantial reduction in the number of individuals who will qualify for state subsidies, while increasing expenditure lines for several religious foundations run by the Iranian religion elite \([Habibi, p. 7](https://www.brandeis.edu/crown/publications/meb/MEB115.pdf)\).
1.13.2.8.2. Pro: Western intelligence officials have offered indirect estimates of Iranian funding of approximately $1 billion per year for Hezbollah and $60 million per year for Hamas, while military assistance to Iraqi groups fighting the Islamic State in 2014 was estimated at $1 billion. \([Habibi, p. 8](https://www.brandeis.edu/crown/publications/meb/MEB115.pdf)\). Any money that goes into the country as a result of lapse of sanctions ends up contributing towards Iran's countless proxy wars.
1.13.2.8.2.1. Con: In the absence of the now returned funds Iran would have had to make some choices about which projects would receive reduced funding. It seems unlikely that they would have passed all of that reduction to their proxy wars. As such the returned money was probably distributed to a wide variety of projects.
1.13.2.8.3. Pro: Between 2014 and 2017, Iran's defence budget grew by 71%, from $9.29 billion to $15.9 billion. Any profits made by the state are funnelled into it's military rather than going towards improving the lives of ordinary Iranians \([Habibi, p. 8](https://www.brandeis.edu/crown/publications/meb/MEB115.pdf)\).
1.13.3. Con: The Iranian government is a theocratic despotic oligarchy that gained more control over its people now that they have a greater influx of money. Increasing economic sanctions will create a greater desire for a regime change creating a more free society.
1.13.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.13.3.2. Con: "Regime change" is often a far from simple process. The collapse of the Iranian political order could result in widespread violence and instability, as it has in [other countries](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/04/africa/libya-chaos-in-graphics/index.html).
1.13.3.3. Pro: For protest and action which is likely to lead to regime change, public anger needs to be at a high level, which would come through increased sanctions. This has been seen in Iran in January and during the Arab Spring with [mounting economic grievances being a driver of protest](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/01/02/what-are-the-lessons-of-the-arab-uprisings-for-irans-protests/?utm_term=.bbf07d2aa473).
1.13.3.3.1. Con: It's possible that increased sanctions would be blamed on the US, particularly given their unilateral nature, and lead instead to increased nationalism and increased support for their existing leadership.
1.13.3.4. Con: The reason there is a desire for regime change is to increase the welfare of Iranian citizens. Other actions should be pursued to achieve such change, rather than ones which harm the welfare of Iranian citizens.
1.14. Con: Key US allies oppose the deal.
1.14.1. Con: The major US allies which oppose the deal, Saudi Arabia and Israel, are dependent on the US for [defence funding](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-israel-defense/key-u-s-lawmakers-want-to-boost-israels-38-billion-defense-aid-package-idUSKCN1GB2NQ), [arms sales](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/approves-proposed-1bn-arms-sale-saudi-arabia-180323090745361.html), and [logistical support](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/yemen-is-a-humanitarian-nightmare-but-the-us-is-resisting-calls-to-end-its-role-in-the-war/2018/03/19/5c8c3bd2-294b-11e8-bc72-077aa4dab9ef_story.html?utm_term=.384b0bb711f4) in their military operations. Disagreements over US policy towards Iran are insufficient reason for them to turn their backs on America when it comes to cooperation on key issues, and there is little evidence that they did so when the Iran deal was signed.
1.14.1.1. Con: The US and its allies that oppose revoking the deal, the UK, France and Germany, are members of NATO, a much more militarily powerful group that are codependent for defence funding, arms sales, logistical support, and personnel training.
1.14.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.
1.14.3. Con: The US should not concern itself with the opinions of other countries, but make its own foreign policy.
1.14.3.1. Con: Alienating key regional allies has the potential to undermine U.S. interests in the Middle East.
1.14.3.1.1. Pro: Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States are critical [allies](http://thehill.com/opinion/international/379542-saudi-arabia-is-a-critical-american-security-partner-in-the-middle-east) in the War on Terror. US efficacy in achieving strategic aims in this region is dependent on their support.
1.14.3.1.1.1. Con: Regional states which are skeptical of Trump's move are also key US allies. Qatar, for example, is home to [Al Udeid](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2018/1/30/qatar-plans-massive-expansion-of-us-military-base), the largest US military base in the Middle East.
1.14.3.2. Pro: What is good for other countries might not be good for the US.
1.14.4. Pro: Saudi Arabia and other Gulf monarchies [oppose](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/04/saudi-arabia-israel-oppose-iran-nuclear-deal-150401061906177.html) the deal on the basis that Iran is their principal geopolitical rival in the region. The lifting of sanctions under Obama empowered Iran in terms of influence in the Arab world.
1.14.4.1. Pro: The [UAE and Bahrain](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/05/world-leaders-react-withdrawal-iranian-nuclear-deal-180508184130931.html) oppose the deal, for example.
1.14.4.2. Con: Many Gulf states expressed reservations about President Trump's move, including [Kuwait, Oman, and Qatar.](http://www.defenddemocracy.org/media-hit/varsha-koduvayur-ripples-in-the-gulf-gcc-states-reaction-to-withdrawal-from-iran-deal-reflec/)
1.14.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.14.3.1.1.
1.14.4.4. Con: We should feel no need to support the policy goals of Saudi Arabia.
1.14.4.4.1. Pro: Saudi Arabia is [responsible](https://www.lawfareblog.com/saudi-arabia-and-united-arab-emirates-have-disastrous-yemen-strategy) for an ongoing humanitarian and human rights disaster in Yemen.
1.14.4.4.2. Pro: Saudi Arabia is profoundly undemocratic and sectarian.
1.14.4.5. Con: Saudi Arabia and Iran are [bitter enemies](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-42008809): Saudi's interests lie in undermining any chance Iran has to become less marginalised on the world stage, even if it is worse for American and international security.
1.14.4.5.1. Pro: Some Saudi regional policies, including its [diplomatic isolation of US ally Qatar](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-40173757), are bad for US interests. America cannot unquestioningly support Saudi aims in the region if they jeopardise its own security.
1.14.5. Con: Equally critical US allies such as the [UK](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43957431), [France](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-france/macron-warns-of-risk-of-war-if-trump-withdraws-from-iran-deal-idUSKBN1I70BS), and [Germany](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-43925422) continue to back the agreement.
1.14.5.1. Pro: Pulling out of the accord and increasing sanctions on Iran means that the US will have to impose some economic sanctions on key allies, like France, the UK and Germany. If anything, it undermines US influence on Iranian policy, of which pulling out was mainly a symbolic gesture to protest Iran's other policies, such as funding groups like Hamas. It's symbolic, because, as independent energy investigators claim, Iran was in fact abiding by the terms of the agreement.
1.14.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.11.3.
1.14.5.2. Con: While those countries are critical allies, they are not direct stakeholders in the future of the Middle East, and therefore the concern of allies who are direct stakeholders should be a higher priority
1.14.5.2.1. Con: When it comes to nuclear weapons we are all stakeholders. This is one reason why the deal did not attempt to address Iran's other interests in the region and why it has widespread international support.
