Discussion Title: We should build an international space elevator?

1. We should build an international space elevator.
1.1. Con: There are better alternatives to building a space elevator.
1.1.1. Pro: An international space escalator would carry more people \(than a space elevator\).
1.1.1.1. Con: A space escalator would require a tilt, which would require more resources and land to construct under it.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Elevator cars get in the way of each other, whereas objects can get around each other on a space escalator.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: If you have two elevator lanes, cars won't cross each other. Same thing that happens with the escalator itself, no difference at all.
1.1.1.3. Con: Nothing is attached on a space escalator \(unless such provisions are made\), which means objects can fall off of it more easily.
1.1.1.4. Pro: People can see their comparative distance between Earth and space while traveling on it \(unless provisions are made on a space elevator to see it too\)
1.1.1.5. Pro: Escalators require less material than elevators.
1.1.1.6. Pro: Escalators require less thrust, since they are at an angle.
1.1.1.7. Con: Both elevators and escalators break down very easily. Thus, this should not be a good idea to delve into, as it is not a viable alternative to the space elevator idea.
1.1.1.8. Pro: If an escalator breaks down, the drop of objects would not be as severe as with a space elevator \(if an elevator's suspension breaks, free fall would be unsafe for both people and cargo\).
1.1.2. Pro: An [orbital ring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMbI6sk-62E) would be a great alternative and might be extremely challenging, but pretty feasible.
1.1.2.1. Con: An orbital ring requires much more materials than a space elevator
1.1.2.1.1. Con: These materials might not need to come from Earth once the foundation is built. Instead, they can come from space, like asteroids.
1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Orbital rings would require more resources from Earth than space elevators, which would be detrimental to both the environment and people's safety \(globally - climate change, and locally - mining dangers\).
1.1.2.2. Pro: An orbital ring has benefits that a space elevator does not.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Orbital rings have less maintenance requirements.
1.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: A space elevator can get damaged more easily than an orbital ring, because a space elevator is near human activity more and has to face the elements on Earth \(such as weather, dust, earthquakes...\).  An orbital ring is in space, away from such factors
1.1.2.2.2. Pro: An orbital ring would not interfere with activities on Earth as much as a space elevator, due to being above normal flight areas
1.1.2.2.2.1. Pro: A minimum of about 50 miles up is the lowest place where an orbital ring would likely be built. In comparison, the highest level that commercial flight takes place is well under 10 miles
1.1.2.2.3. Pro: Orbital rings could provide solar power to Earth, because it gets cloud-free, 24/7 sunlight.
1.1.2.3. Pro: An orbital ring spreads around the globe, which gives the global population more access than a space elevator.
1.1.2.3.1. Pro: Better yet, an orbital ring would require less ground travel to the orbital ring, as it is just "up" instead of "out". This saves on resources and preparation needed to get to a space elevator.
1.1.2.3.2. Pro: An orbital ring would not have political tensions that space elevators create.
1.1.2.3.2.1. Pro: This prevents power-control issues, where countries that have their space elevator hogs the usage and prevents other countries from using it.
1.1.2.3.2.2. Pro: Orbital rings would be scaled according to total usage needs of industry output, rather than group \(a.k.a. country\) usage needs.
1.1.2.3.2.2.1. Pro: The usage priorities switch to industry than by country would be beneficial to prevent political fights.
1.1.2.3.2.2.2. Pro: The switch to industrial needs would prevent inequality in access to space.
1.1.2.3.2.3. Pro: An orbital ring could be globally-owned, as it is located outside of nations' borders \(unlike a space elevator that most likely needs to be planted within one country's borders\).
1.1.2.4. Pro: An orbital ring has dual benefits that space elevators do not.
1.1.2.4.1. Pro: One dual benefit is both traveling/commuting around the Earth and into space. Space elevators only have mainly one: space travel \(except for help given to high-altitude flight\).
1.1.2.4.2. Pro: Orbital rings are possible to both live and travel on. Space elevators can only provide travel opportunities.
1.1.2.4.2.1. Pro: People would not be forced to come back to Earth as much if they do not feel like it, unlike a space elevator \(has no platform to avoid unnecessary trips to Earth.
1.1.2.4.3. Pro: These could be temporary structures \(but do not have to be\), which can be quickly thrown down, pulled up, and moved. A space elevator does not have that luxury \(it has to be permanent\).
1.1.2.5. Pro: Orbital rings are a great start towards expand Earth's civilization out of Earth. A space elevator does not provide such opportunity.
1.1.2.5.1. Pro: An orbital ring has a high capacity to hold people, because it has more space than a space elevator \(which might be able to handle less than 20 loads at best before items start running into each other\).
1.1.2.6. Pro: Traveling on a space elevator needs to be shared like bandwidth \(i.e. there is a limited number of users at one time\). An orbital ring does not have such limits \(people can just fly up easily to the nearby orbital ring.
1.1.2.7. Con: An orbital ring would probably need a space escalator to get to it.
1.1.2.7.1. Pro: Even though the minimum height would be 50 miles from Earth, on a space escalator \(that is trying to avoid issues\) would create a long commute \(due to the angle slant\)
1.1.2.7.1.1. Con: The commute should not be as long as on Earth, since there would be no traffic going up/down.
1.1.2.7.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.3.
1.1.2.7.3. Con: People can board and travel to space on orbital rings that touch Earth, thus bypassing the need for a space escalator.
1.1.2.8. Pro: An orbital ring does the same function as a space elevator \(avoid Earth's escape velocity to get into space\), but with more surface area to achieve it.
1.1.2.9. Con: An orbital ring is more prone to construction errors and halts than a space elevator.
1.1.2.9.1. Con: Orbital ring structures can be built on the ground and then assembled in space, which will reduce construction issues if it were built in space.
1.1.2.9.2. Pro: If issues occur during construction, people would need to travel back-and-forth between Earth and the rings to repair. A space elevator does not have those issues as much.
1.1.2.9.3. Pro: Because the orbital ring is larger than a space elevator, there are more places it could get issues at.
1.1.2.9.4. Pro: An orbital ring is more complex to construct \(especially since has more factors to take into account like: living arrangements, commutes, and travel to/from it\), which would set back the possibilities for constructing it further into the future than space elevators.
1.1.2.9.5. Con: Construction of the spinning center would not have halts due to items falling/flying away, because once something gets into orbits, it stays relatively within the same place. This makes construction really easy and quickly.
1.1.2.10. Con: An orbital ring is unsafe for people to be on. People could be in freefall if they walk off the part that is fixed to Earth's movement.
1.1.2.10.1. Con: There could be a clear encapsulation built on the ring to allow people to move around and view everything, but not fall off.
1.1.2.10.2. Con: Some people want to use that to their advantage \(like sport, such as an extreme form of skydiving\).
1.1.2.10.3. Pro: If the ring is not built correctly, it could be unsafe for people to live on.
1.1.2.10.4. Pro: Since the gravity is lower the higher the orbital rings are built, people could encounter long-term health consequences when staying on the rings.
1.1.2.10.4.1. Con: The rings could be built closer to Earth \(but not too close that it interferes with air travel\).
1.1.2.10.4.2. Con: The orbital ring design could account for this by building into its structure artificial gravity systems.
1.1.2.10.4.3. Pro: People should stay only for short times, because they would need to go back to Earth for long periods after to help their bodies recover.
1.1.2.10.5. Pro: Without proactive counteractive measures, people can get all sorts of short-term health conditions associated with being in space, such as [altitude sickness](https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-exercise/altitude-sickness-flights) and [space adaptation syndrome](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/space-adaptation-syndrome)
1.1.2.11. Con: Although large, one orbital ring would have limitations in freedom of walking around it.
1.1.2.11.1. Con: This could be addressed by scaling the design, such as adding towers below or more rings.
1.1.2.11.2. Con: Capsules to prevent people from falling should be built to accommodate the lower gravitational levels, depending on how high the rings go \(people might be able to at most jump one foot into the sky, but in space, it would be much greater\).
1.1.2.11.3. Pro: Although one could walk the circumference of the Earth practically on the orbital ring, width-wise, people cannot walk that far \(at most, a few feet\) without approaching a wall.
1.1.2.11.4. Con: People would be able to circumnavigate the globe without worrying about barriers \(natural - like water bodies, and artificial\) or national borders.
1.1.2.11.4.1. Con: This could only work if countries do not claim parts of the orbital ring as their own.
1.1.2.11.4.2. Pro: People would freely be able to travel over various countries without worry, just like when flying in an airplane over various countries.
1.1.2.11.4.3. Con: Countries would have to protect their borders even more, as people would be able to freely access countries from the orbital ring out of nowhere without repercussions \(one could just lower a space elevator and go into a country without anyone knowing about it\).
1.1.2.11.4.3.1. Pro: Criminals would get away with crime by escaping to other countries without anyone knowing about it.
1.1.2.12. Pro: An orbital ring is simple in concept and easy to scale/add modules to.
1.1.2.12.1. Con: A space elevator has these features too.
1.1.2.12.2. Pro: Orbital rings can extend out past the solar system, making interstellar space travel possible
1.1.2.13. Con: Orbital rings are not beneficial for people on Earth.
1.1.2.13.1. Pro: An orbital ring is far more dangerous for people on Earth in the case of catastrophic failure.
1.1.2.13.2. Pro: Orbital rings might be block the visibility of night sky, which would be bad for on-Earth astronomical observations
1.1.2.13.3. Pro: An orbital ring is more difficult to maintain by people on Earth.
1.1.2.13.3.1. Con: An orbital ring is a more stable platform to work on than a space elevator \(which could sway as one gets closer to the top\).
1.1.2.13.3.2. Pro: People would need to travel up into space to work on the orbital ring, whereas a space elevator can easily be accessed at the ground level.
1.2. Pro: A space elevator would significantly decrease the cost of future sending of cargo in space.
1.2.1. Pro: Being able to transport materials cheaply into space would benefit the International Space Station.
1.2.2. Con: We should focus on the other ways of making space transportation cheaper that are being explored right now, such as SpaceX's [Falcon 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9).
1.2.2.1. Pro: Reusable rocket technology will make a space elevator economically unfeasible in the near future.
1.2.2.2. Con: Rockets have a [negative](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/the_green_lantern/2009/11/dirty_rockets.html) impact on the environment. If we launched more of them, the impact would be exacerbated.
1.2.3. Pro: The shared elevator benefits nations that cannot afford a space program.
1.2.3.1. Pro: This prevents nations that are less developed from failing in space ventures.
1.2.3.2. Pro: This saves on costs for each nation, as the pooled cost is lower for the individual \(nation\) then if they build their own.
1.2.3.3. Con: A nation that hasn't contributed to the building costs would likely be excluded from benefiting from the elevator.
1.2.3.4. Pro: This is seen from the successes of past international collaborations of space programs, such as the [International Space Station](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/visitors-to-the-station-by-country).
1.2.3.5. Con: There is a lot of [catch-up needed to help the space programs of developing nations](https://www.un.org/press/en/2004/gaspd291.doc.htm), and a shared space elevator might not have the capability to take care of all the needs of today.
1.2.4. Pro: A space elevator requires less resources and efforts to create and maintain for each nation that contributes to it.
1.2.4.1. Pro: It just needs to be built once \(and just maintained afterwards\) for virtually limitless use \(compared to the modern space travel mode of rockets\).
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: Rockets are consumable \(especially the rocket fuel\), need to be brought back, and have some parts disposable \(one reason for [space junk](https://www.space.com/38884-rocket-exhaust-space-junk-pollution.html)\) to repeat the same space process \(such as for deliveries or missions\) that the space elevator achieves effortlessly \(in comparison\).
1.2.5. Pro: A cheaper way to space would be a significant boost to space exploration.
1.2.5.1. Pro: The sheer [cost per pound](http://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-rocket-cargo-price-by-weight-2016-6) using rockets is tremendous. An elevator reduces that dramatically.
1.3. Pro: Overcoming such tremendous technical challenges would yield dividends in materials science, energy, aerospace, computing, architecture, and social organization that would benefit all people, not just those who used the elevator.
1.3.1. Con: A space elevator is not special, as any complex project can provide the same benefits as these. We should prioritize projects over importance and practicality to spend time on projects that truly need our help right now.
1.4. Pro: A space elevator would deconstruct the psychological discontinuity between earth and 'outer space'. This will be essential to the normalization of interplanetary colonization.
1.5. Pro: A project of that scale would require international cooperation, making humanity working on a common goal.
1.5.1. Pro: Organizations like the International Space Elevator Consortium \(ISEC\) are already [cooperating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_elevator#International_Space_Elevator_Consortium_\(ISEC\)) with researchers and other societies promoting space elevators.
1.5.2. Pro: The long-term survival of the human race is dependent upon spreading out the number of places in which we live.  Eventually, Earth will be subject to a catastrophe, either manmade or natural, in which billions of people will perish. The more convenient we can make establishing colonies and habitats elsewhere, the more likely we will not be rendered extinct by such a disaster.
1.6. Con: We are missing and/or lacking in capabilities to accomplish this at the moment.
1.6.1. Pro: A station in the sky to relay between other entities and Earth \(such as a [Lagrange colony](https://www.kialo.com/should-humanity-establish-colonies-on-mars-2495/2495.0=2495.1-2495.15+2495.85)\) might be better \(or at least should be made to work in conjunction with a space elevator\)
1.6.2. Con: "No because we can't yet" is not a valid motivation either. First you should decide if it's useful \(and we are here\), then you should decide how to accomplish it \(only then you'll figure out if it's actually possible or convenient\).
1.6.3. Pro: It would take less resources to solve the low cost transportation to orbit then to build an elevator. Building an elevator requires developing a new material, amassing that material and protecting the elevator once build. Current technology can be refined to meet the need as SpaceX has demonstrated with out developing what would be a new branch of science: reusable rockets.
1.6.4. Pro: We [don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_elevator_construction#Current_status) have the technology required to build such elevator.
1.6.4.1. Pro: The tension that would experience the cable will be very strong and there is not a material that could resist that kind of force. It will snap with the strongest material we got today so it is not a viable solution right now.
1.6.4.2. Pro: The cable itself would have to be hundreds of kilometers long, while still being capable of holding the station, and resist climate, atmosphere, radiations and low-orbit collisions, which is not doable for now.
1.6.5. Pro: There is no nation on Earth willing and/or capable of hosting such an elevator.
1.6.5.1. Con: Luxembourg would do it. [1](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/16/luxembourg-vies-to-become-the-silicon-valley-of-asteroid-mining.html)
1.6.6. Pro: A project of that scale would require an unseen amount of resources.
1.6.6.1. Con: In most scenarios for space-elevator construction, the raw materials for the structure would be harvested mostly from a captured asteroid brought into orbit to serve as a vehicle and cable factory, as well as counterweight.  Since this would \(by definition\) already be outside of Earth's gravity well, the investment would largely amount to bootstrapping this self-sufficient production process.
1.6.7. Pro: Not only don't we have the technology and resources to do this in the near future, there is strong doubt that a space elevator can ever be built. 

[Why we'll probably never build a space elevator](https://io9.gizmodo.com/5984371/why-well-probably-never-build-a-space-elevator)
1.7. Con: A space elevator creates issues with no easy resolve.
1.7.1. Pro: The space elevator could fall apart, which could be costly both for maintenance and for the cargo stuck on it.
1.7.2. Pro: If a space elevator becomes obsolete and abandoned due to better technology, then it would be a lot of clutter and work to demolish and remove.
1.7.2.1. Con: If we don't take the chance of applying current technology due to possibility of better technology, we can never produce or use anything because technology is a process forward, there will always be better technology.
1.7.3. Pro: A space elevator is problematic for airplanes, because it hogs air space and provides a hazard for airplanes to crash into.
1.7.3.1. Con: Airplanes could easily fly around a space elevator.
1.7.3.2. Con: Given a space elevator, airplanes would be replaced by space flight.
1.7.3.2.1. Pro: Space elevators can be used as launching pads for commercial transportation for people and cargo. Traveling through space is much faster than in the atmosphere.
1.7.3.3. Con: The space elevator could have a no-fly zone around it.
1.7.3.4. Con: If there is only one space elevator, then it would not be much of an issue.
1.7.3.5. Pro: Also, if airplanes crash into the space elevator, it could be costly for both the repairs and the affected cargo
1.7.4. Pro: A space elevator could lead to political conflict.
1.7.4.1. Pro: As long as we are a species of warring nations, a space elevator is just the ultimate high ground.  It would be viewed as a weapon and a threat by those who didn't control it.
1.7.4.1.1. Pro: A space elevator could be an opportunity for terrorist attacks \(especially if it is the only option available\).
1.7.4.2. Pro: Nations would battle as to where the elevator is placed, because the land it is placed on and distance from the nation are factors that stir political conflict.
1.7.4.2.1. Pro: If the elevator is placed on a nation's land, they might take ownership over it, which can cause issues for all nations, especially the ones who do not own it.
1.7.4.2.2. Pro: Those further away from the space elevator would have a political disadvantage over those closer to it.
1.7.4.2.3. Pro: The privileged nations might take precedence and priority over other nations.
1.7.4.3. Pro: If nations with more money get better priorities over the space elevator, then this could cause conflicts.
1.8. Pro: A space elevator will make the colonisation of other planets much easier.
1.8.1. Con: There are many other obstacles towards colonising other planets that a space elevator cannot overcome. Thus, space colonisation will not happen any faster until these obstacles are amended.
1.8.2. Pro: [Humanity should colonize Mars - Kialo discussion](https://www.kialo.com/should-humanity-establish-colonies-on-mars-2495/2495.0=2495.1/=2495.1)
1.9. Pro: We are capable of doing so technologically, especially with new advances for resources in construction.
1.9.1. Pro: For example, [carbon nanotubes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl083LAYnoU) could strengthen the cables for better structural integrity
1.10. Con: We may not want to build an *international* space elevator, since capitalistic greed could be a viable motivation into space. Companies or individual nations could opt to construct one and reap the rewards themselves.
1.11. Pro: A space elevator would allow removal of anything deemed unsafe away from humans \(especially dangerous chemicals and safer chemicals that degrade into them\) and into space.
1.11.1. Con: This would make anyone controlling the space elevator immensely powerful. The elevator and storage platform would become terrorist targets.
1.11.2. Con: These dangerous goods would still be in the Earth's gravitational field and thus could plummet back down causing natural disasters.
