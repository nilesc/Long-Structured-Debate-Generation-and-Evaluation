Discussion Title: Does Co-Teaching Meet The Needs Of Most Special Education Students?

1. Co-teaching does not meet the needs of most special education students.
1.1. Pro: Some special education uses the same strategies with or without co-teaching. Which is the same ineffective method of telling the student they did it wrong then saying to do it again and/or showing themselves solving the problem for the student.
1.1.1. Con: This indicates major problems in teaching, rather than in the institution of co-teaching; teachers should be better trained in their jobs if this problem arises.
1.2. Pro: Students with more severe needs get little out of co-taught classes.
1.2.1. Pro: They are also more likely to disrupt non-special needs students if their behaviour difficult to control.
1.2.2. Pro: Time spent in co-taught general education classes does not allow students with special needs the intensive instruction they need to obtain make up growth.
1.2.2.1. Con: Co-teaching can be made in the same space but with special teachers for special needs children.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: Having a special education teacher in the same space as the regular education teacher, and working with only the students with special needs, is stigmatizing and limiting.
1.2.2.1.2. Pro: This allows for better socialisation and integration, as well as focused education.
1.3. Con: Co-education reduces prejudice against special education students by placing them in the same classroom environment as all the other students, without heavily stigmatising the child who has difficulty with the material.
1.3.1. Pro: The expectations of parents, peers and teachers have been [consistently identified](https://cehdvision2020.umn.edu/blog/high-expectations-special-education/) as a key determinant in the academic achievement of children with learning difficulties. By placing them in a typical classroom environment, special needs students are faced with higher expectations from those around them. As a result, their educational outcomes may improve. In contrast, the stigma of separate special education reduces expectations.
1.3.2. Pro: A 1999 [study](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/384762) of deaf and hearing students who were taught in a co-teaching environment identified no negative social consequences of co-teaching for deaf students.
1.3.3. Pro: Co-teaching mitigates the resentment that may occur as a result of a single teacher allocating more time to one student who has learning difficulties. This is because a second teacher can facilitate the student who is having difficulty while the first teacher can continue to work with the class.
1.3.3.1. Pro: [Resentment](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/aug/16/children-disabilities-special-needs-mumsnet-campaign) from peers and parents against students with learning difficulties can have severe impacts on the self-esteem and learning outcomes of those children. Co-teaching may reduce that resentment.
1.4. Con: Co-teaching creates a less-fractured educational experience for special needs children, by ensuring they are able to receive additional assistance alongside their typical education, without having to leave the classroom.
1.5. Pro: Co-teaching does not meet the needs of "most special education students." Special Education is not a homogeneous group. It covers students with Specific Learning Disabilities, Emotional Disturbances, Intellectual Disabilities, Physical Disabilities, Other Health Impairments and more. The needs of these students vary greatly. No single environment in the public school setting can meet all the needs of the majority of students with disabilities or without.
1.6. Pro: Research is limited in the area of student outcomes, but what research has been done has found no marked difference between co-taught, non-co taught and special education single teacher classrooms when it comes to standardized testing.
1.6.1. Con: [Co-teaching](http://faculty.virginia.edu/coteachUVA/whycoteach.html) is, anecdotally and in some studies, starting to show [major benefits](http://ctserc.org/documents/resources/benefits.pdf) [in the classroom](https://uk.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/26099_Villa_Guide_to_Co_Teaching_Chapter_1.pdf).
1.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.
1.6.3. Pro: [Another citation](https://www.ousd.org/cms/lib/CA01001176/Centricity/Shared/The%20Effectiveness%20of%20the%20Co-Teaching%20Model-Inclusion%20Material.pdf) on the lack of research.
1.7. Pro: When trying to keep up with the pace of the gen. ed. classroom, students with special needs get only a cursory exposure to the topic.
1.7.1. Con: This is the responsibility of the teachers to ensure they are sufficiently covering the material for students at all levels.
1.8. Con: When it is done right, co-teaching can be very effective.
1.8.1. Con: This requires a lot of teacher training and experience, which is not always possible at all levels of schooling. The resources needed outweigh the potential benefits.
1.8.1.1. Pro: A [2017 study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319766114_Challenges_to_the_use_of_Co-teaching_by_Teachers) of 77 teachers found that co-teaching both requires a lot of resources for its successful implementation and that teachers often lack the necessary skills for implementing co-teaching.
1.9. Con: Even when the student is not able to get a lot out of the instruction, they are learning valuable social skills.
1.9.1. Con: This is not enough to mitigate lacks in their educational development.
1.9.2. Pro: Students who are constantly ostracised by special education may struggle to other integrate with their peers; it is important to help them however possible to address this issue.
1.9.3. Pro: All students should have the opportunity to participate with their non disabled peers.
1.9.3.1. Con: Not if it is non-constructive.
1.9.3.2. Con: They can participate in group activities and recreation without being co-taught.
1.10. Pro: When special needs students are allowed to be taught in a separate classroom at a slower pace and with materials at their level, they are able to learn more of needed content.
1.10.1. Con: Not all schools can afford to facilitate a specific and separate special education program. Co-teaching may be within reach as an approach to the special needs of certain children for schools which lack these resources.
1.10.1.1. Pro: Best practice models of co-teaching [\(pp. 50- 51\)](http://stars.library.ucf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4426&context=etd) see two teachers collaborate in the classroom to help all of the students in a classroom, while simultaneously identifying and aiding students who need additional help. Support for programmes which help all the students in a classroom, as opposed to a small number of children with severe difficulties, is more likely to be forthcoming from school boards and local governments.
