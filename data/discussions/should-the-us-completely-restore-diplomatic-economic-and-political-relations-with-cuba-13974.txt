1.2.1.1. Con: Companies may be discouraged from doing business in Cuba, due to its [strict domestic policies](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-usa-trade/blooming-u-s-business-interest-in-cuba-wilts-under-trump-idUSKBN1DA1VJ), restrictions on labor, shortage of physical currency, and poor-quality telecommunications.
1.2.2. Pro: Industries such as travel, agriculture, and banks would profit immensely from normalization of relations, thus benefitting U.S. economy at large. [investopedia.com](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/013015/what-cubaus-relations-means-us-industry.asp)
1.2.2.1. Pro: Specifically for the agricultural sector, food exports to Cuba could total over [$1 billion](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-usa-trade/blooming-u-s-business-interest-in-cuba-wilts-under-trump-idUSKBN1DA1VJ), leading to substantial growth.

1.3. Pro: Normalizing relations will benefit the people of Cuba.
1.4. Pro: Improved diplomatic relations between Cuba and the US could set an example for other countries locked in long-standing bilateral conflict.
1.5. Pro: Establishing stronger diplomatic ties with Cuba could incentivize the government to adopt more liberal policies.
1.5.1. Pro: With [Venezuela](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stratfor/2014/12/23/the-geopolitics-of-u-s-cuba-relations/) \(one of Cuba's main economic supports\) experiencing political and economic turmoil, the island is looking desperately to outside countries to preserve its economic integrity.
1.6. Con: A relationship with Cuba will open up the U.S. to possible terrorist threat.
1.6.1. Pro: In recent months, Cuba has become increasingly close with Russia economically, increasing imports from Russian industries. This could potentially lead to a Cold-War era relationship, using Cuba as a proxy venue to terrorize the U.S.[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-russia-analysis/cuba-boosts-trade-ties-with-cold-war-ally-russia-as-u-s-disengages-idUSKBN1ED0FI)
1.6.2. Pro: Russia has already pursued efforts to spy on the U.S. through informants and cyber warfare. With the geographical closeness of Cuba and the U.S., Russia could use Cuba to increase its observance on the U.S. and gain geopolitical advantage.
1.6.2.1. Con: It is unlikely that Russia will utilize Cuba to strike the U.S., due to their limited military and technological capabilities.
1.6.3. Pro: Cuba has already demonstrated their hostility towards the U.S., through the "[sonic attack](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/castro-huddles-with-russia-as-us-cuba-relationship-crumbles)" on U.S. officials on the island.
1.7. Con: President Trump must appeal to interest groups in U.S. that wish for stronger restrictions on the government.
1.7.1. Pro: Cuban organizations, particularly in Miami, largely support President Trump's efforts to make policy more strict. By retracting on this, Trump risks upsetting these organizations and substantial protest.[washingtonexaminer.com](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/cuba/article156579409.html)
1.7.2. Pro: Diplomatic ties with a Communist country goes against American ideals of freedom and democracy. By doing so, the U.S. also risks ideological criticism from domestic sources.
1.7.2.1. Con: America maintains diplomatic ties with China.
