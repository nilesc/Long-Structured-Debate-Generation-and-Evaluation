Discussion Title: Can Someone Truly Be Or Do Something Selfless?

1. Anybody Can Be Or Do Something Selfless.
1.1. Pro: People often do things they don't really want to do because they feel a sense of moral duty. That is what acting morally ultimately means \(according to Kant, at least\). This is because if you do good because it makes you happy, you are being rewarded in a sense.
1.2. Con: Most humans tend to feel good when helping people \(increase of [dopamine and other chemical levels](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5456281/)\). This naturaly grants a reward for altruistic acts and conditions conscious behaviour.
1.2.1. Pro: This means, in practise, that there is no possible way to avoid selfishness.
1.2.1.1. Con: It can be a case of degree: if the sacrifice outweighs the benefit, then the action is more correspondingly selfless. To make it a binary - between 'selfless' and 'selfish' - is unfair.
1.3. Pro: In nature, parents sacrificing themselves so that their child survives is common.
1.3.1. Con: That may be due to a primal instinct that compels beings to guarantee the survival of their species and thus is ultimately not selfless.
1.3.1.1. Con: In which case, it would still be 'self' less; it does not benefit the individual, nor the individual's sense of self. It is done for a greater or higher purpose. As such, it is still fundamentally selfless in the truest of senses.
1.3.2. Pro: When a mother pushes her child out of the way of an oncoming truck and loses her life, she experiences no reward, material or immaterial, for her sacrifice. People often do things for those they love which benefit the recipient more than themselves. Such actions are selfless.
1.3.2.1. Con: The reward is the knowledge - however brief - that her child has survived.
1.4. Con: We expect gratitude or acknowledgement when we do something "selfless".
1.4.1. Con: Not always; many can go unnoticed and do not mind it.
1.4.2. Con: This does not apply to everyone. Many people donate anonymously to avoid gratitude or acknowledgement.
1.5. Pro: Just because it benefits me a bit doesn't mean it is not selfless.
1.5.1. Pro: If the intention is selflessness, that is what matters. Any material gain is incidental.
1.5.2. Con: By knowing the act will benefit you, the act is inherently selfish.
1.5.2.1. Con: Selfless acts need not involve self-sacrifice, and they remain altruistic even when they are performed from a mixture of motives, some of which are self-interested. We should not be confused by the fact that “self-interested” and “altruistic” are opposites. A single motive cannot be characterized in both ways; but a single act can be undertaken from both motives. [¹](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/altruism/#MixeMotiPureAltr)
1.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.6. Con: We often expect something back, albeit not in the same form ie. karma or heaven.
1.6.1. Con: Altruism is an ethical doctrine, [¹](https://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_altruism.html) and Ethics transcends culture, religion, and time; whereas, Morals are culturally and religiously based distinctions of right/wrong. [²](http://www.ethicsdefined.org/what-is-ethics/morals-vs-ethics/) The notion of altruism is applicable not to every morally motivated treatment of others. [³](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/innate-acquired/)
1.7. Pro: Love can make you care more about other people than about yourself.
1.7.1. Con: This has no bearing on selfishness; being in love can be considered selfish, as it has a [lot of benefits](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/sexual-health/benefits-of-love-sex-relationships/).
1.7.1.1. Pro: Love is a luxury, not a necessity; as such, its pursuit and acquisition are selfish.
1.7.1.2. Con: -> See 1.5.
1.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.
1.8. Con: The way people look at us boosts our self confidence or ego.
1.8.1. Con: We don't only act morally when we know someone is watching.
1.8.2. Pro: Being seen as selfless is highly prized in society; it is advantageous to appear as such.
1.9. Con: It goes against a natural instinct of self preservation.
1.9.1. Con: People go against their natural instinct of self preservation all the time. Drugs are an example of this.
1.9.2. Con: In much the same way that Natural Instinct & Self Preservation are considered innate, so too are selfless acts of Compassion \(Biological Altruism [¹](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/altruism-biological/) [²](https://www.philosophytalk.org/blog/psychological-vs-biological-altruism)\), which is: "a complex process that is innate, determined in part by individual traits, and modulated by a myriad of conscious & unconscious factors, immediate context, social structures, expectations, and organizational culture." [³](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4556578/) Additionally, these three terms are not mutually exclusive of one another. [⁴](https://www.alleydog.com/glossary/definition.php?term=Mutual+Exclusivity)
1.10. Con: There needs to be a true sacrifice for the action or gift to have meaning therefore it is not done without reason.
1.10.1. Con: "Altruistic acts include not only those undertaken in order to do good to others, but also those undertaken in order to avoid or prevent harm to them... Furthermore, altruistic acts need not involve self-sacrifice, and they remain altruistic even when they are performed from a mixture of motives, some of which are self-interested... \(because\) A single motive cannot be characterized in both ways; but a single act can be undertaken from both motives." [¹](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/altruism/#MixeMotiPureAltr)
1.10.2. Con: It is not necessarily fair to say that somebody must sacrifice something to be selfless; selflessness may be prioritising others, not compromising oneself.
