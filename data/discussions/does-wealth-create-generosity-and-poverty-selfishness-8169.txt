Discussion Title: Does Wealth Create Generosity And Poverty Selfishness?

1. Wealth creates generosity and poverty creates selfishness.
1.1. Con: The divide between the poor and the rich widens. If wealth concentration would create generosity the trend would be reversed.
1.1.1. Pro: The onus of responsibility has to be on those who have sufficient resources to be generous.
1.1.2. Con: Generosity alone cannot remedy the widening social and ideological gap between classes, although it may help certain parties survive better.
1.2. Con: [Statistically](https://www.fool.com/retirement/2016/11/27/the-average-americans-charitable-donations-how-do.aspx), poor people actually give a much higher percentage of their income than do wealthy people - likely, because they can better empathise with the need.
1.2.1. Con: Wealthier people [give more to charities](https://nypost.com/2018/07/04/the-backwards-link-between-social-status-and-generosity/) than poorer people.
1.2.2. Pro: [Empathy](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/hidden-motives/201008/why-are-the-poor-more-generous) is a key element in functional generosity, with class divides showing very rigid and self-perpetuating tendencies; ie, our current class divisions continue to widen as those in different classes empathise more strongly with those at a similar level, and find it harder to empathise with the opposite viewpoint.
1.3. Pro: Generosity is trumped by other needs, [such as survival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs).
1.3.1. Con: If we take 'selfishness' as defined acting for "personal profit or pleasure" then poorer people are not selfish: they are not working for profit, nor pleasure, but simple survival, and this is a huge distinction.
1.3.2. Con: Generosity doesn't have to mean monetary, and so, there is no excuse for being selfish; those struggling for survival can still show kindness, give their time if not their money. There are very few in a position to not be able to give something, even if it is minimal.
1.3.3. Pro: Generosity is a luxury only accessible by those who have the means to be so.
1.3.4. Pro: For a poor person, struggling to survive, thinking about helping others is not a priority. They are selfish, not because they are bad people, but because they can't afford to be generous.
1.4. Con: Wealth is created primarily by [exploiting](http://blog.therules.org/the-real-story-of-wealth-creation/) and abusing of others. There's nothing generous about that.
1.4.1. Con: This is one opinion on how wealth is accrued, and not necessarily a representative picture.
1.4.2. Con: Generosity in other areas, despite the problems with how people accrue wealth, is not mutually exclusive.
1.4.3. Pro: Those with socialist leanings strongly argue that working-class people are [systemically exploited](https://socialistworker.org/2011/09/28/what-do-we-mean-exploitation).
1.5. Con: Wealthy people are not generous, they are [more greedy,](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-wealth-reduces-compassion/) and that's the biggest problems that we as a society are facing.
1.5.1. Pro: Wealthier people like to keep [more control](https://nypost.com/2018/07/04/the-backwards-link-between-social-status-and-generosity/) over the money they earn.
1.5.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.
1.6. Pro: Poverty can provoke selfish, even criminal, behaviour.
1.6.1. Pro: Economic crises can turn respectful and law abiding citizens into criminals, looting for food and resources without care for who they negatively affect. Poverty makes them selfish.
1.6.1.1. Con: It is wrong to equate hunger and desperation to people becoming selfish; starvation compels people to action.
1.6.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.1.
1.6.1.3. Pro: The crisis affects shopkeepers and their livelihoods, which will then be thrown into further jeopardy by looting; those looting are not only selfish, but deliberately endangering the lives and livelihoods or others.
1.6.2. Pro: Venezuela is currently going through a massive economic crisis that has led to months of constant looting, turning ordinary citizens into criminals.
1.7. Pro: Wealth allows for greater generosity.
1.7.1. Con: Not having does not make one selfish, however. There may be diminished generosity, but the response to that is not that somebody is selfish.
1.7.2. Pro: The USA - the country with the most millionaires in the world - is also the top country that donates to charity.
1.7.2.1. Con: This is a strange metric. It doesn't mean the millionaires are the ones giving: it's simply a case that there is a sufficiently large population that it outweighs other countries in their charitable donations.
1.8. Con: Compassion creates generosity which is not predicated by wealth. Anyone who wishes can give to those less fortunate. One less well off may give less in total but ultimately more as a percentage of their total wealth.
1.9. Pro: A selfish person is typically one that doesn't take care of himself physically or mentally, as poverty often provokes. People who take care of themselves feel better and more grateful, which leads to greater generosity. As such, poorer people are likely to be more selfish than wealthy people.
1.9.1. Con: Poor people are actually the most generous of all, because they posses the value of humility, something that's easily forgotten when you only care about making money.
1.9.1.1. Pro: It is vital to remember that generosity comes in many different forms.
1.9.2. Con: There is no reason to think that selfish people do not take care of themselves physically or mentally. If anything, it would be the opposite.
1.9.3. Pro: Selfish people develop bitterness and a sense of inferiority, and are less able to appreciate others.
1.9.3.1. Con: There is no evidence to suggest that selfish people develop bitterness and inferiority, even less that they will not be able to appreciate other people.
1.10. Con: Generosity by rich people has egoistic motivations.
1.10.1. Con: This seems quite a leap. It is not fair to assume that all generous actions are, by their nature, selfish.
1.10.2. Con: This assumes negative motives that cannot be verified. True philanthropists do exist.
1.10.3. Pro: Being generous helps rich people to feel better by giving them some worthwhile activity.
