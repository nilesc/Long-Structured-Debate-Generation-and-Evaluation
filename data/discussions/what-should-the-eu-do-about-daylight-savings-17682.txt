Discussion Title: What should the EU do about daylight savings?

1. What should the EU do about daylight savings?
1.1. Keep the current arrangement. i.e. the variation of standard clock time between summer and winter.
1.1.1. Con: No evidence was found that people sleep more on the night following the winter switch. Furthermore, the summer switch leads to losses in sleep for 2 weeks [doi.org](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smrv.2012.10.001)
1.1.2. Pro: If the EU remains inactive member states can find their own best solution.
1.1.2.1. Pro: In Northern member states there are different requirements time-wise than in the South since during winter it stays dark very long.
1.1.2.2. Con: It is within the reach of the EU to decide on daylight saving time since the [European Parliament](https://www.rt.com/news/418282-eu-daylight-saving-time/) debated such a proposal.
1.1.3. Con: Shifting our biological clock twice a year is a stress factor to be eliminated.
1.1.4. Con: LED lights require 6 to 7 times less energy than old-fashioned incandescent bulbs. This fact voids the original pro-argument \(energy saving through aligning the active period with the daylight\).
1.1.5. Pro: Changing to daylight savings time, saves energy.
1.1.6. Con: Changing clocks has a direct economic cost
1.2. Switch to permanent wintertime
1.2.1. Con: The morning rush hour would happen in the dark
1.2.2. Pro: Wintertime is the best approximation of astronomical time \(sun is highest at noon\). Thusly best match with biological clock. Assuming a [normal rythm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm_sleep_disorder#Normal_circadian_rhythms) and usual working/bedtime hours. See also \(sorry in German only\) [this warning about permanent summer time](https://www.dgsm.de/downloads/aktuelles/Stellungnahme%20Sommerzeit%202018.pdf) from the German Sleep Society \(DGSM\).
1.2.3. Pro: Moving the time reference should really not be the way to organize living: schedules should be. So if children are too tired in winter monings, shift school hours instead of shifting time. Wintertime is the "canonic" time where 12:00 means sun is highest and should be used as reference.
1.3. Switch to permanent summertime
1.3.1. Pro: People will be happy to have more natural light in their leisure time.
1.3.2. Con: Human biology adapts to seasonal changes \(longer winter nights\) better with permanent wintertime. [The effects of season, daylight saving and time of sunrise on serum cortisol in a large population](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/07420528.2013.844162?journalCode=icbi20)
1.3.3. Con: It will be harder to start work and school in the morning, because it will remain darker for longer. Productivity will fall.
1.3.3.1. Con: Schools and indoor workplaces have lighting, so this point is moot. In outdoor jobs, there will still be the same number of hours of daylight, so it doesn't matter.
1.3.3.2. Con: The time between waking up and starting to work \(~2 hrs\) is significantly less than the time between finishing work and going to bed \(~6 hrs\). Thus, it is a good idea to have daylight longer in the afternoon when outdoor activities may take place.
1.3.3.3. Con: Schools could start later, this is a possibility currently being explored in research for its pedagogic and health benefits
1.3.4. Pro: Energy will be saved in residential lighting in winter.
1.3.5. Con: Energy will be wasted for increased residential heating in winter
1.3.6. Pro: Shops benefit from the extra afternoon hour of sunlight
