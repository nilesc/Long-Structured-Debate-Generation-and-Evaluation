1.7.1. Pro: "The Dispossessed" describes an anarchist society.
1.7.1.1. Pro: It imagines the possibility of an anarchist society, but the story could take place on our earth as well. As such, it's a superb critique of capitalism.
1.7.1.2. Pro: Anarres society sees everyone as equal and equally capable, without forcing anyone to use their talents or interests unless they want to. This is inspiring.
1.7.1.2.1. Con: Anarres society falls into the trap of hierarchies as well, though. Realizing this is Shevek's reason for leaving.
1.7.2. Pro: "The Left Hand of The Darkness" is a unique hard sci-fi and fantasy mix, constructing a con-culture essentially from scratch and exploring a society with unique gender specifics.
1.8. Lois McMaster Bujold
1.9. Nancy Farmer
1.10. Madeleine L'Engle
1.10.1. Pro: Strong female main characters.
1.11. Lois Lowry

1.15.1.1. Pro: Meredith NicEssus is a faerie princess turned private investigator in a world where faeries are not only known to the general public, but are also fashionable. She takes on the pseudonym "Merry Gentry" to hide from her family and her past while hiding out in Los Angeles as a private investigator. Merry, the only Sidhe \(pronounced "shEE"\) royal to be born on American soil flees the Unseelie Court in a final act of self-preservation.
1.15.1.1.1. Pro: The general tone of the writing is less of an outright fantasy and more of an alternate history. The point of divergence from normal history is not provided, although hints are given about how the faerie history intersects with human history \(Adolf Hitler, the Irish Potato Famine, and Thomas Jefferson are examples\). In the books, Jefferson gave the Unseelie and Seelie courts asylum after the European courts exiled them.
1.15.1.1.2. Pro: Merry's aunt, Andias the Queen of the Unseelie Court has set a contest between her son and Merry. The first to bear an heir will inherit the throne.
As Merry beds the Ravens, guardians of the queen, in an attempt to get pregnant before Cel inherits the throne, she and the guards must fight off numerous attempts at assassination. All this and she still has her day job as a private detective at Grey's Detective Agency.

1.15.1.2. Pro: Anita Blake is the title and viewpoint character of the Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter series. The series takes place in a parallel world in which supernatural characters like vampires and werewolves exist alongside regular humans, with Blake's jobs including the re-animation of the dead as well as the hunting and executing of supernatural creatures that have broken the law.
1.15.1.2.1. Pro: Starting with book 10, the series shifts in tone from crime noir thriller to focus more predominantly on sexual themes. Anita Blake becomes infected with the ardeur, a supernatural power inadvertently given to Anita by her vampire Master Jean-Claude that gives her massive amounts of power but also demands that she have sexual intercourse with several different people through the course of a day, sometimes in large groups.
