Discussion Title: Military Air Shows should be discontinued.

1. Military Air Shows should be discontinued.
1.1. Pro: Noise pollution would be reduced.
1.1.1. Con: This is a marginal amount of noise pollution, especially considering that commercial airlines fly every day.
1.2. Pro: Military Air Shows can be dangerous to participants and spectators.
1.2.1. Pro: The [disaster at the Ramstein air show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramstein_air_show_disaster) killed killed 67 spectators and 3 pilots.
1.2.2. Pro: There have been well over 100 air show [accidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_air_show_accidents_and_incidents_in_the_21st_century) since 2001.
1.3. Pro: The money could be better spent on public services
1.3.1. Pro: The cost of fuel alone for an air show amounts to over [$40,000](https://www.sfgate.com/local/article/That-Blue-Angels-show-you-just-saw-wasn-t-exactly-9139046.php).
1.3.2. Pro: The pentagon estimates the annual [cost](http://www.ou.edu/deptcomm/dodjcc/groups/00C2/AIR.HTM) to be $2,000,000.
1.3.2.1. Con: The Defense Department budget for 2018 is [$639 billion](https://dod.defense.gov/News/Special-Reports/0518_budget/), making this a minuscule expense.
1.3.3. Pro: Budget [cuts](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/03/18/budget-sequester-military-air-shows/1992993/) are reducing the amount available for military readiness. In this context, airshows are wasteful.
1.3.4. Con: They are a highly visible public spectacle that comes at very low cost for municipalities and city halls \(as opposed to parades, concerts etc\) and therefore local and regional resources can be used on public services
1.4. Con: The demonstration of a strong military makes citizens feel safer and other countries less likely to attack your country.
1.4.1. Pro: The perception of a strong military can serve as a deterrence mechanism.
1.4.1.1. Con: The perception of a strong military can also raise tensions, such as when North Korea [showcased](https://www.businessinsider.com/north-korea-parades-icbm-in-show-of-force-before-south-korea-olympics-2018-2) its ICBMs in military parades.
1.4.2. Con: Conventional [use](https://www.pri.org/stories/2014-09-16/us-now-involved-134-wars-or-none-depending-your-definition-war) of the military demonstrates admirably its potential.
1.5. Pro: Burning less fossil fuels would reduce carbon emissions
1.5.1. Con: Military planes are flown regularly for exercises, patrols, and training. Stopping one flight a year is a marginal reduction in pollution that would likely be offset by another scheduled flight for another purpose.
1.5.1.1. Con: Pilots are required to train for [thousands of hours](https://www.globalresearch.ca/inconvenient-truths-about-military-air-shows/5305197) and practice almost daily to be able to perform the stunts in an air show.
1.5.2. Pro: The jet propellant JP-5 is highly toxic and contains known [carcinogens](https://www.globalresearch.ca/a-short-history-of-the-costs-of-military-air-shows/5647827).
1.5.3. Con: Compared to the emissions caused by civilian air travel, this pollution is insignificant.
1.6. Con: Military air shows are popular and entertaining for the public.
1.6.1. Pro: The [Blue Angels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Angels) perform for 11 million people annually.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Blue Angels shows can generate money for the local economy where they perform, in some cases as much as [$2.5 million](https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/local/air-show-attendance-sees-huge-increase-over-last-year/AV4sfcfk7s94ieBvO28pzI/).
1.7. Con: They inspire people to be interested in STEM fields.
1.8. Pro: It promotes war and conflict which have significant negative ramifications for those caught in the middle

1.9. Pro: The jets are a traumatic reminder \(and sometimes triggers for PTSD\) for those who've fled conflict zones
1.9.1. Con: These airshows are easily avoidable by remaining indoors during the brief period of the show.

1.10. Con: They are a way for pilots to demonstrate their skills and the capacity of the jets!
1.10.1. Con: They are also a way for the AirForce to 'engage' with the public, when they are usually in the background of the public eye
1.11. Con: They inspire national pride for those who are pro-militarisation and connect ornaments with a countries power \(and ability to defend itself\)
1.11.1. Con: America arguably suffers an [inability](https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/02/01/we-must-reclaim-american-patriotism-from-leftists-and-from-trump/) to judge its historical actions justly becasue of over zealous national pride. It does not need this additional push.
