Discussion Title: If God is Real, Should we File a Class Action Lawsuit Against It?

1. If God is real, then we should file a class action lawsuit against it.
1.1. Con: This would be a waste of time, as it would be unenforceable.
1.1.1. Pro: God is unlikely to answer summons.
1.1.2. Con: This would be an exercise in futility but exercising is good so we should.
1.2. Con: Human laws and regulations don't apply to or account for the existence of a god.
1.2.1. Con: They should.
1.2.1.1. Con: There is no way to account for the existence of an omnipotent being.
1.2.2. Con: This is untrue; human laws and regulations are, broadly speaking, based on the religious systems that formed them.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Religious texts play a central role in the US court system.
1.2.2.2. Con: Human laws regulate the actions of humans, not other beings.
1.2.3. Pro: Laws are made by the state. You must accept them if you wish to live in the land that made them. You can live outside the law, but you cannot enjoy the protection of the state. God does not live in a single state and does not require the protection offered by a state. It would be impossible to apply a law in this case. So it would reasonable instead to murder god as a form of instant retribution for his crimes. This cannot be done because Nietzsche already killed him.
1.2.4. Pro: If God is real and is really a god \(being the creator of EVERYTHING\), that makes God the most wise being in the Universe. Therefore, there is a purpose for everything and no matter how bad it seems to us, God will ALWAYS be right.
1.3. Pro: Publicly denouncing perpetrators of harm by finding them guilty in court is beneficial to victims and their families.
1.3.1. Pro: It would be worth filing the lawsuit as an act of retribution; the ability to somehow fight back against the ultimate omniscient, omnipotent being is tempting to those who have been harmed in such a being's name.
1.3.2. Con: There is no real penalty that could be enforced; the desire for true retribution can never be fulfilled.
1.3.2.1. Con: The penalty isn't necessarily the most important aspect; it is more vital to have some sense that there is somebody culpable, to remove the sense of helplessness many can feel.
1.3.2.2. Pro: Retribution can be just in the acknowledgement of guilt and the promise of no further poor behaviour.
1.4. Pro: Repositioning God as a sue-able entity could help shift the public's faith to science rather than religion.
1.4.1. Pro: The attempt to frame God as sue-able would likely illuminate the concept that God is in fact not sue-able, following futile attempts to make God legally liable in any actionable way. This futility \(and its frustration of the legal process\) would in turn likely disillusion people with religion's role in legal matters \(sworn testimony, church and state jurisprudence, etc.\).
1.4.1.1. Con: There is precedent that God is suable.

1.4.2. Pro: Suing god gives credibility to a made up idea. It presents him as a person as only a person can be sued.
1.4.3. Con: God is the collective consciousness, existing in each and every one of us. Thus, suing God would be like suing ourselves.
1.4.3.1. Con: This doesn't matter. The premise of this debate is that God is treated as a separate entity; given that none of us having the omnipotence or omniscience of God, we can safely say we are sufficiently distinct.
1.4.4. Con: If as the topic states we assume God is real, then science and faith in that God are not mutually exclusive.
1.5. Con: God would wield its almighty power in order to unfairly influence the court's decision.
1.5.1. Pro: God controls everybody and likely would not allow anybody to file this lawsuit.
1.5.1.1. Con: In the Judeo-Christian faith, God gave man free will, and thus, the ability to act beyond God's control.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: Considering he was not immediately aware of Eve eating the forbidden fruit or Cain murdering Abel in the Book of Genesis, it would be reasonable to assume our free will goes beyond his omniscience.
1.5.2. Pro: Jehovah by his own admission is [jealous](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+20%3A5&version=NIV), he is [prideful](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+1%3A9-12&version=NIV), and [wrathful](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+25%3A17&version=ESV) when angered.
1.5.3. Pro: On the assumption that God would could turn up in court it would most likely have the best lawyers.
1.6. Con: The legal fees would be prohibitive.
1.6.1. Con: This could be tackled; there are plenty of wealthy people who would be interested.
1.6.2. Con: We could start a GoFundMe campaign
1.7. Pro: God is circumspect to all things. Thereby, inherently guilty.
1.7.1. Con: God isn't guilty of any offense for which he could be sued.
1.7.1.1. Con: Many court cases have found "act\(s\) of God" liable for a broad range of offenses. \(One source: [wisbar.org](https://www.wisbar.org/NewsPublications/WisconsinLawyer/Pages/Article.aspx?Volume=84&Issue=4&ArticleID=2350)\)
1.7.1.1.1. Con: Despite being named as such, it actually refers to [natural phenonema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_God#Tort_law) that is unreasonable or impossible to defend against, such as earthquakes or tsunami.
1.7.1.2. Con: Even if this is true, we'll never know for sure without a proper trial
1.7.2. Con: The idea of accusing God is very old, and is of both theological and philosophical interest. In [the book of Job](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+38&version=NIV), for example, the idea is dismissed, since we do not have adequate knowledge of God's plans with the world, and consequently cannot see pain and evil in the greater context that they ought to be seen within.
1.7.2.1. Con: This depends on the end justifying the means, which is hugely debatable.
1.7.3. Pro: It would give publicity to the deep flaws of an entity with an immense cult of personality behind it. It would reveal the man behind a curtain that has controlled people’s sensibilities en masse for millennia.
1.8. Pro: We should file the lawsuit for all the people that have died and didn't get a chance to "hear the good news."
1.8.1. Con: Caveat emptor \(let the buyer beware\). God never promised your life would be without struggle or harm. No promises were made.
1.9. Con: This would be offensive to religious people
1.9.1. Con: Whether or not it's the right thing to do doesn't depend on people's opinions.
1.9.1.1. Con: If what is right is not dependent upon the opinions of people, then it is dependent upon the opinion of God
1.9.2. Con: It is offensive to others that an all-powerful being is taking control without being accountable.
1.9.2.1. Con: God, if he does exist, does not ‘take control’, by definition he already has control
1.9.3. Con: If a practice or belief is harmful then it should be open to criticism.
1.10. Con: God has much more important things to worry about than petty litigation.
1.10.1. Pro: A class action lawsuit would be a huge waste of God's time.
1.10.1.1. Con: God's omnipotence exceeds our temporal universe.
1.11. Pro: We could win
1.11.1. Pro: This is actually a reasonable prospect from a religious perspective, particularly a Jewish one. There are multiple instances in the Hebrew Bible in which God's characters argue with him, sometimes succeeding to change his mind.

1.11.2. Pro: If we all came together God would be more likely to listen
1.11.3. Con: According to the Judeo-Christian Bible, God created the world in a good state. Evil entered the world through Adam, Eve and Lucifer. As such, the 'bad' in the world is not God's fault, and so we would not would win such a lawsuit.
1.11.4. Pro: God did bad things like killing innocents, something that according to the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/udhrbook/pdf/udhr_booklet_en_web.pdf) should be condemned.
1.12. Con: It has [already been attempted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuits_against_God) multiple times. As expected, unsuccessfully
1.13. Con: The very concept of a sovereign God suggests that God is not answerable to human authorities.
1.13.1. Pro: How can we assume to understand the motivation of an omniscient, omnipotent God with our limited view of the universe and therefore, what grounds do we have to sue?
