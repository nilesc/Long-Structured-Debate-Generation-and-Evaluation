Discussion Title: Should Minors Need Parental Consent for Abortions?

1. Parental consent should be required for pregnant minors to have abortions.
1.1. Pro: Parents have the right to know about any significant activity of their underage teens as they are in many ways responsible for them and thus they should be included in such a decision.
1.1.1. Con: To this general rule there are plenty of limitations. Abortion could easily be one of them.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Parents cannot decide about the sexual orientation of children
1.1.1.2. Pro: The choice of faith is up to the children;  not the parents.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: In Germany parents can baptize their children and the minor cannot resign from church unitl he/she has reached the age of 14. [1](http://www.refrago.de/Wie_tritt_man_aus_der_Kirche_aus_und_was_kostet_ein_Kirchenaustritt.frage172.html)
1.1.1.3. Pro: Teens can get tested for STDs and treated afterwards without their parents knowing.
1.1.1.4. Pro: One limitation would be pregnancy, as the daughter is only obliged to tell her parents if she wants an abortion. Bearing and raising a child is her own choice.
1.1.2. Pro: Abortions are not cheap and typically have to be paid privately.
1.1.2.1. Pro: In the USA an abortion is pretty expensive with [up to $1,500](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/in-clinic-abortion-procedures). In Germany a surgical \(outpatient\) abortion costs approximately [€460](https://www.profamilia.de/fileadmin/publikationen/Reihe_Koerper_und_Sexualtitaet/Schwangerschaftsabbruch_englisch_2010.pdf), whilst a medical abortion costs around €360.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: In special situations health insurance is covering the costs.
1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Children are usually in a family health insurance, so the costs are after all coverd by the parents paying insurance fees.
1.1.2.1.1.2. Con: The rate of insurance fees for whole family insurances is influenced by the general expenditures of the insurance company and only to a lesser extent individual behavior.
1.1.2.2. Con: Having a child is much more expensive than having an abortion.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: It costs a projected €120.000, or more, for one child until they are fully aged.[familie.de](http://www.familie.de/eltern/wie-viel-kosten-kinder-536481.html)
1.1.3. Con: Teenagers are having a right to independent sexuality and its consequences. Parents should have no right to interfere with this.
1.1.4. Pro: If a teenager inflicts damage on someone, it is generally the parents that are responsible for paying for the damage. The law in this case recognizes that the child should not be responsible. The decision to have an abortion is a serious one. As parents are in many ways responsible for their children, they should be included in this decision as well.
1.1.4.1. Con: Aborting a child is not likely to inflict damage on third parties, thus parental liability is not applicable.
1.1.4.2. Con: Since pregnant minors will be engaged in risky behavior it would actually reduce the exposure of the parents. Thus parental liability would actually favor that parents do not have a right to know.
1.1.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.
1.1.4.4. Con: For most teenagers, friends are more important than family. They are the ones they would like to talk to; Not necessarely the parents.
1.1.4.5. Con: This argument begs the question: "the decision to have an abortion is a serious one". That is a debatable premise.
1.1.4.6. Pro: Parents can be hold liable for their childrens' harmful actions, whether negligent, intentional or criminal and they can be sued. It is called [parental liability](http://family.findlaw.com/parental-rights-and-liability/parental-liability-basics.html).
1.1.5. Pro: In the long run, the decision whether or not to terminate the pregnancy does not only affect the teen mom, but her parents as well.
1.1.5.1. Pro: As many teen moms become single moms, the decision would probably affect the mother's parents.
1.1.5.2. Con: Consent would actually equal a veto and thus equal powers. Since the long term effects, however, do more rest on the daughter it is disproportionate to give the parents equal saying.
1.1.5.3. Con: In cases where the under-aged couple stays together and carry that through, also the father's parents would carry a significant burden. Only involving one side in these situations would give disproportionate powers to the mother's family.
1.1.5.3.1. Con: In case they do not want to abort this becomes meaningless in the first place.
1.1.5.3.1.1. Con: Not if the father continues the relationship regardless of whether an abortion was performed or not. In this case a refusal by the mother's parents would have consequences not only for the daughter but also for the father and his family.
1.1.5.4. Pro: If she decides not to keep the baby, whether it is through abortion or adoption, the emotional ramifications of that decision will affect the parents as the teen experiences them.
1.1.5.5. Pro: If she decides to keep the child, the parents are affected in more ways than one. They will likely be the ones that are responsible for supporting the baby financially as most teenage mothers are unemployed. They will also be responsible for the care of the child during school hours while the teen is attending classes.
1.1.5.5.1. Con: They do not have to be the child's legal guardian.
1.1.5.5.1.1. Con: They are responsible in certain situations such as when the daughter has no financial means to support the child.
1.1.5.5.2. Con: Legally the young mother does not have to tell her parents as they do not have any say in the matter.
1.1.5.5.3. Con: Financial aid from grandparents often occurs, in all age categories, regardless.
1.1.5.6. Con: If the abortion was without complications and successful it is not necessary that it will have an effect. They just could continue their lives as before.
1.1.5.7. Pro: Parents could alter their decisions on financial support for higher education due to reduced returns to be expected.
1.1.5.7.1. Pro: Instead of investing in the child for a decent elderly living they might invest it in other fields.
1.1.6. Con: Parental consent would only affect abortions, not pregnancies. So a girl can bear and raise a child without her parents' consent. Suddenly having a teen mom in the house will affect their life way more than an abortion.
1.1.6.1. Con: Parents of a minor are financially responsible for any complications resulting from the abortion, unless said minor has been legally emancipated, thus they should have a say.
1.1.6.1.1. Pro: Parents do have the duty to take care of financial activities of minors.
1.1.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.
1.1.8. Con: There could be a conflict of interest in cases where immoral actions by a parent caused the pregnancy in the first place.
1.1.9. Con: Teens can get dead drunk legally by the age of 16 and parents do not have the right or responsibility to cope with that either.
1.2. Con: If a young woman has decided to become sexually active, she should be allowed to decide whether to have an abortion and whether to choose to involve her parents in the decision about an abortion.
1.2.1. Con: When aborting they are killing the unborn baby. Some parental counseling should be required to contemplate the decision and its consequences.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Many people do not know what consequences an abortion will have on their body, e.g. infertility.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: Due to modern treatment long term effects are very unlikely. [spiegel.de](http://www.spiegel.de/gesundheit/sex/statistik-zahl-der-abtreibungen-in-deutschland-weiter-gesunken-a-958384.html)
1.2.1.1.2. Pro: The process itself, for example, is accompanied by severe stress and the abortion procedure can be painful in itself. Many women report that they were just glad once it was over. \([svss-uspda.ch](http://www.svss-uspda.ch/de/berichte_meinungen/frauen.htm)\)
1.2.1.1.3. Con: Most pregnant women thinking about abortion would probably get information about the consequences. Doctors/official information centers are almost always better resources than parents.
1.2.1.1.3.1. Con: We're not talking about adult women, but teenage girls \(minors\). Teenagers might be intimidated to visit a doctor / official information center on their own.
1.2.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Talking to strangers about such a grave problem knowing there will be no repercussions might be easier and less intimidating.
1.2.1.1.3.1.2. Pro: They might abstain from it for fear of being recognized in public.
1.2.1.1.3.1.3. Con: But she does not have to go alone. She can take her boyfriend or a friend with her.
1.2.1.1.3.1.4. Con: When having an abortion on your own, having a counseling session on your own does not seem like a harder thing to do.
1.2.1.1.3.1.4.1. Con: Talking about feelings is often more difficult than to act upon those feelings. It requires self-reflection and can thus be hurtful. An abortion in contrast can just be done and the heart can harden to cope with it. Counselling sessions would break up this hardened heart.
1.2.1.1.3.1.4.2. Pro: Parental consent is not the only option. In Germany everyone who wants to have an abortion is obliged to being counseled before. [1\)](http://www.bmfsfj.de/BMFSFJ/gleichstellung,did=98262.html)
1.2.1.1.4. Con: These question are best answered by professional counselors/doctors who are available to those seeking legal abortions.
1.2.1.2. Con: In this case, rather than making parental consent a requirement, those pregnant teens should be obliged to being counseled by neutral, official information centres before an abortion.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: Neutral information centers often do not offer an atmosphere of trust and understanding over a longer period of time. Only family can provide such a support
1.2.1.2.2. Pro: If pregnant teens were obliged to being counseled by official information centres, the government can make sure that the young woman actually is getting support. Not all parents want or can help their pregnant daughter.
1.2.1.2.3. Pro: Information centers are likely to be staffed by better informed individuals, such as doctors or persons who have experienced an abortion.
1.2.2. Pro: She will be the one carrying the main consequences and thus the right should be on her.
1.2.2.1. Con: The dead baby would likely disagree with that statement given the chance.
1.2.3. Pro: In developed societies women, at least in a technical abstract understanding, know about the potential consequences of sexual activity. Thus, they took the risk into consideration just as everyone does.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Even if we assume that they would be too young to fully understand how birth control tools work, it is the practice using them that makes you more skilled; not age or knowledge.
1.2.3.1.1. Con: Practicing would assume some sort of inherent safety from making the mistake. Masterbation might fall under that practice as it cannot produce a baby. However full intercourse that results in pregnancy is no longer practice.
1.2.3.1.2. Con: Certainly the knowledge of what the tool does or does not do is as critical as practice of using the tool. Otherwise practicing the use of the tool for the wrong job is impractical. At certain ages, often referred to as minors, children are literally incapable of comprehending this knowledge.
1.2.3.2. Con: Consequences refers to the known outcome of a choice. To then abort because an already known outcome took place is acknowledgement that the first choice of having sex was in fact a mistake. Thus the minor has proven that they are incapable of making good decisions.
1.2.3.3. Con: Even though by the time teenagers start to become sexually active they know how babies are made, they never think it could happen to them. Therefore, they never actually consider the risk.
1.2.4. Pro: Pregnancy is part of sexual activity. Thus, when we say a woman has the freedom to engage in sexual activities the moment she decides to, then this includes a priori an acknowledgment on the right to abortion.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Even if the fetus is a person and has a right to life, a woman should have the right to control her own body and its life-support functions.
1.2.5. Con: It is not the womens' sole decision to become sexually active.
1.2.5.1. Pro: There is a legal age to engage in sexual intercourses. In Germany for example 14 is a magical line. [bravo.de](http://www.bravo.de/dr-sommer/wann-ist-sex-erlaubt-237891.html)
1.2.5.1.1. Con: But teenagers can practically engage in sexual intercourse before reaching that age and even get pregnant.
1.2.5.1.1.1. Pro: On well-nourished girls, [menarche](http://www.thebiomedicapk.com/articles/320.pdf) usually takes place around the age of 12 or 13.
1.2.5.1.1.2. Con: They can, but in fact they do not. The average age for first time sexual intercourse increased recently. [zeit.de](http://www.zeit.de/online/2009/29/keenies-zahlen-fakten/seite-2)
1.2.5.2. Pro: There is social pressure to choose the right moment for the first time that will influence when to start sexual freedom.
1.2.5.2.1. Pro: Since there is a difference in the age of first sex among societies it can be presumed that there are social forces that influence this decision.
1.2.5.2.2. Pro: Some teenagers decide to have sexual relationships because their friends think sex is cool. Others feel pressured by the person they are dating.
1.2.5.2.2.1. Pro: The peer group has some bearing on teenagers' decisions about sex. Pressure to engage in sex increases during middle adolescence. Peer group attitudes about sex [influence](http://www.naswdc.org/practice/adolescent_health/ah0202.asp) the attitudes and behaviors of teenagers.
1.2.5.3. Pro: It requires a sexual partner. So it is not a sole decision.
1.2.6. Con: Abortion is no simple matter, and it involves mature considerations of all options available. A teen not mature enough to handle birth control / condoms is surely not mature enough to decide about abortion.
1.2.6.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.
1.2.6.2. Con: A decision about abortion is not a technical but an ethical question. Thus teens are not as capable of dealing with it as adults.
1.2.6.2.1. Pro: Ethics is not something that can be learned but that resides within one self and will be always in flux with all experiences one makes. That adults have 'learned' more ethics is thus not correct. They just have a different ethic.
1.2.7. Con: The most important decision-making centres of the brain are simply not fully developed in teens.
1.2.7.1. Con: There is no right answer to this question. Thus brainpower is no good indicator if the decision is correct. That is a result of feeling which is developed relatively quickly.
1.2.7.2. Con: That does not mean that teenagers' decision making is less trustworthy. Their decision making process is just very different. Teens are more likely to take more risks in general, but they also gain more from taking these risks.
1.2.7.2.1. Con: Risky behaviour is probably not the best attribute for someone having to decide upon an abortion.
1.2.7.2.1.1. Con: Risky behavior can go into both directions, abortion or not, and is more a style of human behavior equal to risk averse behavior.
1.2.7.2.1.2. Con: People who take the risk and get the child might be very happy after they notice how great it is to have the baby.
1.2.7.2.1.3. Pro: An abortion is a serious matter that needs to be thought through, unlike taking risks when gambling for fun or taking part in thrill-seeking sports, etc.
1.2.7.3. Pro: The brain is developed at 25 years of age. \([ngm.nationalgeographic.com](http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/10/teenage-brains/dobbs-text)\)
1.2.7.3.1. Con: In the first three years, a child’s brain has up to twice as many synapses as it will have in adulthood.
1.2.7.3.2. Pro: Around that age the brain is at the peak of its capacity. [welt.de](http://www.welt.de/wissenschaft/article13521955/Motivationsprobleme-belasten-geistige-Fitness.html)
1.2.7.3.2.1. Pro: Einstein developed his relativity theory with 26
1.2.7.4. Pro: The [greatest changes](http://www.actforyouth.net/resources/rf/rf_brain_0502.pdf) to the parts of the brain that are responsible for functions such as self-control, judgment, emotions, and organization occur between puberty and adulthood. This may help to explain certain teenage behavior that adults can find mystifying, such as poor decision-making, recklessness, and emotional outbursts.
1.2.7.5. Con: Deciding on an abortion is not a neurological issue, but an ethical one. Everyone should have the right to decide over their lives themselves, despite the "development" of their brain.
1.2.7.5.1. Con: The decision whether to have an abortion or not should not merely be made on emotional and ethical grounds, as it is a life-affecting decision that cannot be undone. Thorough consideration and reflexion are essential.
1.2.7.5.1.1. Con: It is not necessarily parent counseling that provides the best route out of this dilemma. Official centers might be better equipped for this task.
1.2.7.5.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.2.
1.2.7.5.1.1.2. Pro: Studies show that an unusually high percentage of teen pregnancies occur in unstable families and that pregnant women living in such families are facing major conflicts. So these minors might receive better support from official information centres. [1\)](http://www.bzga.de/botmed_13300032.html)
1.2.7.5.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.3.
1.2.8. Pro: It is her body she makes the decision to keep or abort the child.
1.2.9. Pro: She should have the right to decide over her body herself and over whom she informs about important life decisions.
1.2.9.1. Pro: The right to exercise control over and make decisions about one’s sexuality, including sexual activity and reproduction, is part of human rights.
1.2.9.1.1. Pro: Reproductive and sexual rights as part of human rights was affirmed internationally at the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development \([ICPD](http://www.unfpa.org/icpd)\) in Cairo in 1994.
1.2.9.1.2. Con: There are legal restrictions on when one is allowed to have sexual intercourse. In this sense, parental consent legislation could follow that model.
1.2.9.2. Con: Restrictions are placed on the legal rights and freedoms of minors in societies all around the world. In many countries, parental consent is required for medical treatment, body modification such as piercings or tattoos, and marriage of minors. Almost every country restricts, by age, permission to drive or to drink alcohol. It should be the same with abortions.
1.2.9.2.1. Con: However, the legal age varies in many countries \(from 16 to 21\), so it seems that there is no consensus on what age distinguishes a minor from an adult. So it seems rather difficult to make clear restrictions.
1.2.9.2.1.1. Con: Even if it is difficult every society has laws that distinguish a minor from an adult.
1.2.9.2.1.2. Con: Different countries can set different age limits for requiring parental consent and adopt it to their cultural background.
1.2.9.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.1.2.
1.2.9.3. Con: Parents might be liable in terms of legal and financial support for the child and thus should be included to the extent they will carry responsibility.
1.2.9.3.1. Pro: It would be unfair if parents could be sued in front of court without having knowledge.
1.2.9.3.1.1. Pro: Grandparents can be hold liable for their grandchildren. [rechtsanwalt-ehescheidung.de](http://www.rechtsanwalt-ehescheidung.de/news/Kindesunterhalt_-_Grosseltern_haften_fuer_ihre_Enkel)
1.2.10. Con: Since these young women are legally considered minors, the state does not consider them to be capable of giving legal consent towards sex. This is why having sex with a minor is considered criminal regardless of consent.
1.2.11. Con: Pregnancy is part of sexual activity, thus the decision to have a baby is also made. The choice to abort is a conscious acknowledgement that the first choice was a mistake.
1.2.12. Con: Parents have mostly invested heavily in the education of the child in order to secure a safe retirement for themselves. While the daughter is free to act, a child would fundamentally alter this economic calculation. Parents should thus have a right to be consulted or informed.
1.2.12.1. Pro: Parents rely very often on their children for support when they are old. Having highly educated children is helpful.
1.2.12.1.1. Pro: Their higher chances of economic success are financially beneficial.
1.2.12.1.2. Pro: Educated people are likely to have more empathy and thus ability to understand the situation and needs of the parents when old.
1.2.12.1.2.1. Pro: Education helps the 6 steps of becoming more empathic. [greatergood.berkeley.edu](http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/six_habits_of_highly_empathic_people1)
1.2.12.1.2.2. Con: Empathy education is mainly conducted on primary school level. [oxfam.org.uk](https://www.oxfam.org.uk/~/media/Files/Education/Teacher%20Support/Think%20pieces/empathy_education_web.ashx)
1.2.12.2. Con: In most countries where women actually can have an abortion, safe retirements do not depend on their childrens' education level.
1.2.12.2.1. Con: There is more and more poverty among the elders in Germany. [welt.de](http://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article133975279/Altersarmut-wird-in-Deutschland-zum-Alltag.html)
1.2.12.2.1.1. Con: Childrens' higher education levels will not necessarily change that, as these children might think the same way and rather invest money in their own children than giving it to their parents.
1.2.12.2.1.1.1. Con: This is not strategical as you show the kid that there is a legitimate claim to not help you when you get older. In your self-interest it is necessary to show your child that helping elderly parents is a necessity.
1.2.12.2.1.2. Con: Still the quota of poor elders is still relatively low compared to other EU-countries and to the quota of poor young people in Germany.[1\)](http://www.bpb.de/apuz/153127/anmerkungen-zur-diskussion-ueber-altersarmut?p=all)
1.2.12.2.2. Con: The EU recognizes that "the proportion of people at risk of poverty in old age is increasing". [Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2009:077:0115:0122:EN:PDF)
1.2.12.2.2.1. Con: Also in countries like Germany the proportion of people reaching higher educational qualification is constantly rising. That obviously does not lead to less poor retirees.
1.2.12.2.2.1.1. Pro: In Germany the quota of university graduates went up from 8 \(1970\) to nearly 30 \(2010\).
1.2.12.2.3. Con: Many countries do not have good pension systems. In the US for example most workers are on their own to provide the means for retirement. [bls.gov](http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2012/12/art1full.pdf)
1.2.12.2.4. Pro: More female than male retirees are poor. One of the main reasons is, that they gave up their job in order to raise their children. The reason for poverty for women are children, no matter what their childrens' education level might be.
1.2.12.2.5. Con: Safe retirement is not only expressed in financial terms but also in terms of taking care of that person. To do so decently the offspring needs to be wealthy him/herself.
1.2.12.2.5.1. Pro: Retirement homes are perceived as of lower quality than multi-generation housing [focus.de](http://www.focus.de/gesundheit/ratgeber/gehirn/therapie/tid-15332/medizin-das-pflegeheim_aid_430219.html)
1.2.12.2.5.1.1. Con: There are luxury retirement homes.
1.2.12.2.5.2. Con: Daughters that get children earlier are more likley to be able and willing to support elderly parents.
1.2.12.2.5.2.1. Pro: Since many burdens fall on the parents in case of teenage motherhood there will be a stronger sense of gratitutde and family.
1.2.12.2.5.2.2. Pro: In rural China daughters are better to sustain elderly parents than sons. [amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/Filial-Piety-Practice-Discourse-Contemporary/dp/0804747911)
1.2.12.3. Con: This discussion is not about parents having a right to be "consulted or informed" regarding their daughter's pregnancy, but about their right to consent abortion.
1.3. Con: Forcing the pregnant girl to tell her parents might reduce the young father's sense of responsibility for his girlfriend's pregnancy.
1.3.1. Con: Young fathers who do not want children \(which is the majority I suspect\) have sufficient incentives not to make someone pregnant. An additional threat to tell your parents about an abortion would be secondary.
1.3.1.1. Con: Boys do not have significantly less sufficient incentives than girls. As both are responsible for the pregnancy, both should be involved in the decision whether to keep the baby or not.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: Women must have total control in this choice. Men will not suffer the social, religions, or physical consequences, thus they should not have the legal power to be involved.
1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: When the woman choses to abort, the man may suffer psychologically due to the fact of losing an unborn child.
1.3.1.1.1.2. Con: If women should have an absolute say over this matter, they also should not be forced to tell their parents.
1.3.2. Con: Pregnancies are often incidental for the father too.
1.3.3. Pro: German studies show that young fathers want to be responsible for their child, but do not feel like they are an important factor in their girlfriend's decision. Parental consent might reinforce these doubts.[1\)](http://www.gesundheit-nds.de/downloads/dokusojung...neu.pdf)
1.3.4. Con: Young fathers are not released from their responsibility if the baby is born. Thus they cannot steal themselves out of responsibility.
1.3.4.1. Con: Fathers should not have the right to influence decisions about abortion and thus should be as much secluded from it as possible to give the woman no pressure and help herself to find what is right for her.
1.3.4.1.1. Pro: They might pressure the woman to a wrong decision.
1.3.4.1.2. Pro: If the case is decided in favor of abortion fathers might break up afterwards.
1.3.4.1.3. Con: Abortion should not only be about what is right for her \(future mother\), but for them \(future parents\). So naturally the father should be involved.
1.3.4.1.3.1. Con: When the father of the child gets involved, conflict can increase which causes the mother stress.
1.3.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: Men will pressure the women to follow their opinion as several stories show. [zeit.de](http://www.zeit.de/2009/08/Abgetrieben-Paar-08/seite-3)
1.3.4.1.3.1.2. Pro: Men just do not have an understanding about the issue and thus are more likely to reach flawed conclusions.
1.3.4.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: Men are typically not prepared for an unwanted pregnancy and will have no idea how to react.
1.3.4.1.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: For women they might have given deeper thoughts about it than men who might not be concerned about the issue that much.
1.3.4.1.3.2. Con: It is the woman's body, and she will carry the responsibility for a decision. The father of the child is only responsible if the mother chooses to have the child.
1.3.4.1.3.3. Pro: If the father of the child gets included in the decision, it could keep relationships from ending.
1.3.4.1.3.4. Con: Women can, and should, decide how much they want to involve the father on an individual basis.
1.3.4.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.1.3.2.
1.3.5. Con: -> See 1.3.4.1.
1.3.6. Pro: To him it would seem that only the girl and her parents should decide about keeping the child or aborting it.
1.3.6.1. Con: The young father appears to have no say anyway in the decision. So there is no need to take care of his responsibility for an abortion.
1.3.6.1.1. Con: Most girls tell their partner about an unwanted pregnancy and it can be assumed that these boys are involved in the decision making process.
1.3.7. Con: -> See 1.3.6.1.
1.4. Con: If children receive enthusiastic consent of their parents an uncertain teen mum might feel pressured by her parents to go through with the abortion instead of listening to a last minute change in personal opinion.
1.4.1. Con: Minors can be peer pressured from partners and friends as well. But no one, father of the child or parents of the mother, should have legal power over the final choice.
1.4.2. Pro: As pregnant teenagers can suffer from self-esteem [issues](http://www.onlymyhealth.com/psychological-issues-teenage-pregnancy-1337682232),it could be benifical to have parents who are focusing on their child's future involved.
1.5. Pro: Parental consent should be required with the exception that the minor can be excused from involving a parent if she is a victim of abuse.
1.5.1. Pro: When facing something so traumatic such as sexual abuse, the minor must not be dependent on parental consent.
1.5.1.1. Pro: Most cases of sexual abuse happen within the family. Forcing the pregnant victim to tell her mother will make the situation even worse.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: Reporting it to the mother might prevent a repetition in future
1.5.1.1.2. Con: Especially in a family the victim needs support by someone in her immediate surrounding. The mother can be such a source of support.
1.5.1.1.2.1. Con: In some cases the anger and mistrust against the mother is the biggest, as some victims believe that the mother should have protected them, and many victims suspect that the mother even knew and did not stop the sexual abuse from occurring.
1.5.1.1.2.2. Con: In some cases the mother does know of the abuse, but does not help her child. So she will not be someone the pregnant minor will want to talk to.
1.5.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: The mother has proven to be unreliable as a source of protective help.
1.5.1.1.3. Con: The confession of the rape, would be a great side effect of having to tell the parents. It makes legal consequences for the rapist more likely.
1.5.1.1.3.1. Con: Many feel they do not want to tell their parents. This decision should be respected. This [person](http://www.med1.de/Forum/Beziehungen/583874/?p=5) for example reports that she does not want her parents to know.
1.5.2. Pro: Sexual abuse is a very serious matter requiring doctor's advice and treatment \(physical and phsychological\). It should be up to the girl, if she wants to open up about it to her parents and involve them.
1.5.3. Con: To prove that one was victim of abuse is involving a time consuming law suit. This would be logically before an abortion could be performed without parental consent.  Yet, by the time a lawsuit is decided the time window for abortion closes. The length of proceeding is typically 6 months. [justiz.gv.at](https://www.justiz.gv.at/web2013/html/default/8ab4a8a422985de30122a93207ad63cc.de.html)
1.5.3.1. Con: For the victim to prove the abuse, it would be enough to seek a doctor / go to the police who would then examine the victim and determine the sexual abuse.
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: In case of rape, seeking a doctor is currently enough to prove abuse. [vorabtreibung.net](https://www.vorabtreibung.net/content/abtreibung-nach-vergewaltigung)
1.5.4. Con: Showing legally that one was a victim of abuse will inevitably let the parents know.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Parents of minors are legal representatives and thus will be legally required to play a role in any lawsuit.
1.5.4.1.1. Con: However, the parents would not have a right to consent, if the child would want to abort.
1.5.4.2. Con: -> See 1.5.4.1.1.
1.5.5. Con: People will lie about being abused, so they don't need to tell their parents and get the abortion
1.6. Con: Parental consent laws might lead to minors having abortions in other states or countries that do not require parental consent and/or have less restrictive abortion laws.
1.6.1. Pro: [Studies](https://www.guttmacher.org/report/impact-laws-requiring-parental-involvement-abortion-literature-review) from the US show that some pregnant teens leave their state to have an abortion.
1.6.2. Con: While this may be an outcome of a parental consent law, and it should be accounted for, it is not a substantial argument against the implementation of a law.

"We shouldn't enact a law because people will find a way around it," isn't a good defense of why a law is/isn't helpful or good..
1.7. Con: Parental consent bears disadvantages for the minor.
1.7.1. Pro: Parents who are opposed to abortion might force their daughter to continue with the pregnancy against her wishes, even if remaining pregnant represents a significant risk to her health or life.
1.7.1.1. Pro: Many pro-life activists have children and might not allow them to abort.
1.7.2. Pro: Parental consent laws might delay young women’s abortion care, leading to riskier, later-term abortion procedures.
1.7.2.1. Pro: For example, following enactment of Missouri's parental consent law, the proportion of second-trimester abortions among minors [increased by 17%](https://www.aclu.org/laws-restricting-teenagers-access-abortion).
1.7.2.2. Con: It would offer them a prescribed time frame to think if they do not want to reverse their decision and keep the baby
1.7.2.3. Pro: Parents cannot make an instant decision about such an important topic. They will feel burdened too.
1.7.3. Pro: Some parents might become physically or emotionally abusive to their daughter, or throw her out on the street if they learn of the pregnancy.
1.7.3.1. Pro: Especially fundamentally religious parents might get angry upon hearing that their daughter has sinned.
1.7.3.1.1. Con: Violence has no place in fundamental religion. Jesus would say that you should forgive; not punish.
1.7.3.1.2. Pro: Very religious persons tend to be very conservative. And very conservative people tend to believe physical punishment is an adequate form of education.
1.7.3.2. Con: Physical abuse of a child is an issue of itself, and ought to be treated accordingly \(no matter what the "reason" for the abuse is\). To counteract against this with objecting parental consent for abortions is no remedy for the problem.
1.7.3.3. Pro: Poor parents might abandon their daughter and child due to the economic burden.
1.7.3.3.1. Pro: In developed countries, especially in big cities, the costs of raising a child can be pretty high.
1.7.3.3.1.1. Con: People in developed countries tend to be able to sustain a living even if you add another child. So the economic burden is not that high.
1.7.3.3.2. Con: Due to the consent law they could persuade their daughter to have an abortion, thus there would not be an extra-heavy economic burden.
1.7.3.3.3. Con: This could also happen without partental consent being required, if the parents would find out.
1.7.3.3.3.1. Con: Without the legal requirement of parental consent, the chances of her parents finding out about the pregnancy are lower.
1.7.3.3.3.1.1. Pro: The daughter could have an abortion early on and the parents would never know.
1.7.3.3.4. Con: Poor people tend to have more children anyway and thus any additional child is not much of a burden.
1.7.3.3.4.1. Pro: Some poor people might even consider having more children on purpose, so they can receive child allowances from the state.
1.7.3.4. Con: Parents who are already willing to do this will do it anyway for another reason. So the pregnancy is not really the triggering factor.
1.7.3.4.1. Pro: Parents who become abusive to their children have experienced the same during their childhood. Thus it would not be the pregnancy that makes them hit the daughter but their childhood experience.
1.7.3.4.1.1. Con: Their childhood experience might be the reason for them being abusive, special incidents \(such as an unexpected pregnancy\) might however trigger single outbursts of violence.
1.7.4. Pro: Parental consent laws might increase the number of unsafe, illegal abortions.
1.7.4.1. Pro: If the minor was raped a confession of the pregnancy to the parents would equal the confession of being raped. Many people would feel ashamed of being raped and would want to keep that a secret.
1.7.4.1.1. Pro: Many cases of rape are not properly dealt with because women feel afraid that no one believes them or that they will suffer from social stigmas. [sueddeutsche.de](http://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/scham-scheu-beweisprobleme-warum-so-viele-vergewaltigungen-nie-ans-licht-kommen-1.1355233)
1.7.4.1.2. Con: -> See 1.5.1.1.3.
1.7.4.2. Con: Even though there are exceptions, in general, most children have a healthy relationship with their parents, thus they will not fear to talk to them and will even be happy to get their advice and support.
1.7.4.2.1. Con: Those children can talk to them without the parental consent.
1.7.4.2.1.1. Pro: Teenagers having a good relationship with their parents will talk to them anyways, and the ones who cannot talk to their parents for several reasons, should not be forced to do so.
1.7.4.2.2. Con: Children might fear that their pregnancy would disrupt this healthy relationship and rather opt for an illegal abortion.
1.7.4.2.3. Pro: Even if one of the parents is more strict. The other one typically has an open ear for the concerns and can be taken as an ally for the difficult discussions ahead.
1.7.4.2.4. Con: An unusually high percentage of teen pregnancies occurs in [unstable families](http://opendoors.com.au/education/?page_id=110).
1.7.4.2.5. Pro: Most pregnant teenagers talk to their mothers about their pregnancy.[1\)](http://www.profamilia.de/fileadmin/info/6959.pdf)
1.7.4.3. Pro: Many young girls feel they cannot talk to their parents about their sex lives or about rape that they may have suffered, so they might seek illegal \(unsafe\) abortions as a result.
1.7.4.3.1. Pro: Daughters of fundamentally religious parents might be especially reluctant to confront their parents with the news of a pregnancy and might see an illegal abortion as their only option.
1.7.4.3.2. Con: Hiding a fundamental decision will complicate the relationship to ones parents and be a barrier to complete trust.
1.7.5. Con: Parents are concerned with the mental and physical well being of the minor.
1.7.6. Con: Parents have far more life experience and can appropriately balance the disadvantages with advantages.
1.7.7. Pro: Some minors may already be in an abusive situation, which disadvantages the minor
1.8. Con: Parental consent should not be mandatory. However, the counseling of both, parents and child, ought to be strongly advised.
1.8.1. Con: Parental notification might come with the same negative consequences \(as parental consent\) for young girls. Counseling of the girls - without involvement of the parents - should be enough.
1.8.1.1. Con: Parental notification requirement is a lesser measure since eventually parents could not force their child to keep the child.
1.8.2. Pro: As underage girls are in most cases still part of their parental household, parents ought to be included in the counseling procedure. Parents and child form a unit in financial, emotional and legal terms.
1.8.3. Pro: Parents also have to cope with a different situation and will experience stress. So they need advise as well.
1.8.4. Pro: Counseling all parties involved enhances the likelihood that everyone is better coming along with the situation.
1.9. Con: Parental consent bears disadvantages for the unborn.
1.9.1. Pro: If parents do not consent an abortion, more babies will be given up for adoption or growing up with unhappy mothers that do not really want them.
1.9.1.1. Con: Adoption is not that bad. The adopting parents would be very happy to get a child and can form a happy family.
1.9.1.2. Con: Close mother-child-bonds will develop during pregnancy and early motherhood. Thus these babies will be equally loved as wished-for babies.
1.9.1.2.1. Pro: Even those that have problems with developing mother child bonds can go and see a pregnancy counselling before or after giving birth.
1.9.1.2.2. Con: This would make the seperation of mother and child after birth even worse.
1.9.1.2.2.1. Con: If there are strong feelings the child will not be offered for adoption.
1.9.2. Pro: [Historically](http://www.ourbodiesourselves.org/health-info/impact-of-illegal-abortion/), when abortion is disallowed attempts to terminate still occur which jeopardize the mother and the unborn child.
1.10. Pro: Parental consent is required for the sake of the minor.
1.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.2.
1.10.2. Pro: This might prevent the pregnant minor from being pressured into having an abortion by an older boyfriend, so as to conceal the fact that he is guilty of statutory rape.
1.10.2.1. Pro: There have been situations in which a child molester has secretly taken an under-aged girl to have an abortion, in order to cover up his crime. Parental notification could help expose the sexual abuse.
1.10.2.1.1. Con: There are less stringent and more personal forms to prevent this than parent involvement, for example a requirement to talk to a doctor and then wait four days before you are legally allowed to perform an abortion.
1.10.2.2. Con: -> See 1.5.1.1.
1.10.3. Pro: Pregnant minors would be prevented to abort for the sake of the underaged father and could concentrate on their own feelings.
1.10.3.1. Pro: Especially teens might be vulnerable to feel pressure by their boyfriend to abort.
1.10.3.2. Pro: Teens might feel that they should abort to keep the relationship with their partner.
1.10.3.3. Con: However, pregnant minors could instead be forced to keep their baby for the sake of her parents, if they should not agree to an abortion.
1.10.4. Pro: Consent laws would give parents a chance to counsel their teenage daughters about the possible consequences of abortion.
1.10.4.1. Con: Parents are likely to be bad counselors. After all, they have hardly any experience in abortions. Otherwise they would not have kids in the first place.
1.10.4.1.1. Con: Just because the teens' parents have children does not mean they never had an abortion.
1.10.4.2. Pro: Deciding whether to have an abortion or continue the pregnancy will probably have a major long-term impact on the teen's psychological and emotional well-being, her ability to continue formal education, her future financial status, etc. Consent laws help pregnant teens to get support and guidance from their parents in this important decision.
1.10.4.3. Pro: Requiring parental consent is the only way for governments to ensure that minors receive the psychological and emotional support they need.
1.10.4.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.7.5.1.1.2.
1.10.4.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.3.1.4.2.
1.10.4.4. Pro: Parents know their daughters better than anyone else and can therefore offer them better advice than doctors or official information centres.
1.10.4.5. Con: Studies show that nearly all pregnant teens tell their mothers about the pregnancy. It can be assumed that these mothers already do counsel their daughters about the possible consequences of abortion. [1\)](http://www.profamilia.de/fileadmin/info/6959.pdf)
1.10.4.5.1. Con: This shows only the importance of the requirement to talk to the parents. Those who do not want to should be encouraged by the consent requirement.
1.10.4.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.7.3.
1.10.5. Con: Parental consent is required for the sake of the minor accept in certain instances.
1.10.5.1. Pro: [Parental](https://www.aclupa.org/our-work/duvall-reproductive-freedom-project/minorsaccesstoconfidential/minors-health-care-and-the-law/) consent is not required when the minor has graduated from high school.
1.10.5.1.1. Pro: This indicates medical autonomy is not about age but maturity.
1.10.5.2. Pro: [Parental](https://www.aclupa.org/our-work/duvall-reproductive-freedom-project/minorsaccesstoconfidential/minors-health-care-and-the-law/) consent is not required when the minor is married.
1.10.5.3. Pro: [Parental](https://www.aclupa.org/our-work/duvall-reproductive-freedom-project/minorsaccesstoconfidential/minors-health-care-and-the-law/) consent is not required when the minor is pregnant.
1.10.6. Pro: Parental consent should be required because abortion in general can take an emotional and psychological toll on someone especially a teenager. Someone that is undergoing an abortion requires emotional support.
1.11. Pro: Parental consent is required for the sake of the unborn.
1.11.1. Pro: Parental involvement laws might reduce the number of teenage abortions.
1.11.1.1. Con: Statistically parental consent laws [do not reduce](https://www.guttmacher.org/report/impact-laws-requiring-parental-involvement-abortion-literature-review) the number of teenage abortions.
1.11.1.2. Con: Teenage abortions, if thought through consciously, are not generally a bad thing.
1.11.1.2.1. Pro: Teenagers might be unable to take care of the baby.
1.11.1.2.2. Pro: When teenagers have children they change their life to a great extend. So, they might not be able to enjoy their lives adequately.
1.11.1.3. Pro: A study by the [Heritage Foundation](http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2007/02/analyzing-the-effect-of-state-legislation-on-the-incidence-of-abortion-among-minors) stated that overall, parental involvement laws reduce the number of teenage abortions.
1.11.2. Con: -> See 1.9.2.
1.12. Pro: Parental consent should be required on the condition that if the father of the child is also a minor, his parents are aware of his contribution to said pregnancy and consent is sought from them as well.
1.12.1. Con: Too many people are being asked to give consent about a decision which affects only one person for 9 months.
1.12.1.1. Con: The more people who are involved in knowing about a pregnancy, the more support may be found for preventing an abortion.
1.12.1.2. Con: An abortion’s impact is lifelong and not restricted to 9 months.
1.12.2. Pro: As the parents of the father may be paying his child support checks, it is considerate to involve them in the decision.
1.12.3. Con: Requiring so much consent may have the effect of delaying or eliminating access to abortion.
1.13. Con: Principles of bodily autonomy should not be ignored simply because a woman is underage. Women have a right to control what happens to their bodies, and parents should not be able to overrule such significant and personal decisions.
1.13.1. Pro: In most countries, minors who are old enough to be likely to be sexually active are already allowed to control [a significant portion of medical decisions](https://www.guttmacher.org/about/gpr/2000/08/minors-and-right-consent-health-care). It is not clear that abortion should be any different.
1.13.2. Con: [Parental](https://www.aclupa.org/our-work/duvall-reproductive-freedom-project/minorsaccesstoconfidential/minors-health-care-and-the-law/) consent is generally required before medical care of a minor to ensure intelligent and transparent treatment.
1.13.3. Pro: The teenager will be responsible for the child anyway after she \(the mother\) becomes an adult, not her parents, so her choice have to be respected.
1.14. Pro: Parents are the closest adults in a minors life that care about their interests.
1.15. Pro: Doctors require parental consent for most medications and procedures. Abortions, due to their long lasting implications \(should the fetus come to term\) should not be an exception.
1.15.1. Con: Abortion is unique among medical procedures in that many people see it as immoral and seek to end it. An exception should be made for abortion in order to shield female minors from unwarranted scrutiny .
1.16. Pro: Parental consent is needed because otherwise children may abort out of a perceived fear of parents’ reactions.
1.16.1. Con: In cases of Religious or Conservative households, said teen could experience real violence or excommunication or worse.
