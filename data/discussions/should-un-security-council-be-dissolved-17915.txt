Discussion Title: Should UN Security Council be dissolved?

1. The UN Security Council should be dissolved.
1.1. Pro: The UNSC is controlled only by the big powers.
1.1.1. Pro: Giving five of the world biggest/strongest allies permanent membership and veto is definitely testament to control by Big Powers.
1.1.1.1. Con: The five UNSC permanent members are not allies.
1.1.2. Con: Temporary members also have a say and are relevant to UNSC decisions.
1.1.2.1. Con: Even if all the non-permanent members have a common position, UNSC would not adopt it unless all Big Powers don’t veto it. Only one big power can change the decision from being adopted.
1.1.3. Pro: The UNSC's veto power ensures that major powers can safeguard their vital interests.
1.2. Pro: The effectiveness of the UNSC is currently restricted, as they don't have power to enforce their resolutions.
1.2.1. Con: Even a "condemnation" or embargo by a member nation can have adverse effects.
1.2.1.1. Con: The UNSC has [condemned](https://www.un.org/press/en/2006/sc8853.doc.htm) North Korea's nuclear program since 2006, but to little effect.
1.2.2. Con: This is not entirely true as the Security Council can adopt resolutions under art. 42 of the UN Charter that permits member states acting nationally or through regional organisations to take all necessary measures including military force to enforce its decisions. You can read more about that [here.](http://www.un.org/en/sc/repertoire/actions.shtml#rel4)
1.2.2.1. Pro: [Art 42 of the UN Charter](http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-vii/index.html) specifies that the UN can enforce their resolutions and "may take such action by air, sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security".
1.2.3. Pro: Veto power demonstrates how permanent members could stop a resolution for the common good only because of its sole interest.
1.3. Con: The UNSC is at least trying to organize the world. If it is dissolved, more chaos will be unleashed.
1.3.1. Pro: It's better to try than give up.
1.3.1.1. Con: If there are better ways to try, then those means should be pursued instead.
1.3.2. Pro: If countries like the USA, China, or Russia felt that they no longer had a stake in the world order commensurate with their power and status, they would have little incentive to act in a restrained manner.
1.3.2.1. Con: Current restraint from China and Russia largely comes from fear of military retaliation, especially involving nuclear weapons, rather than preserving their stake in the world order.
1.3.3. Con: Countries would use bilateral and multilateral alliances to maintain a balance of power and stability if the UNSC was dissolved.
1.4. Con: There is no better solution than the UNSC.
1.4.1. Con: The current UNSC system of P5+1 could become more inclusive to better reflect the changing demographics/power balance of the world.
1.4.1.1. Pro: As the second most populous country in the world, India deserves a permanent seat.
1.4.1.2. Pro: No African or South American countries have a voice in the P5.
1.4.2. Pro: The international community is used to the current structure, and changing it would complicate international relations.
1.5. Pro: The membership concept is not democratic.
1.5.1. Pro: Permanent membership is an example of inequality and undemocratic concept of membership.
1.5.2. Pro: It is claimed [in this paper](http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/06-029.pdf) that non-permanent member countries receive aid that makes the process prone to bribery and is not transparent.
1.5.3. Con: It is impossible to have a completely democratic system, as no one would agree on anything
1.5.3.1. Con: Democracy doesn’t mean all agree on everything. It means among other things that the majority decides, fair chance for all parties and no discrimination
1.5.4. Con: Some states are unstable. Some nations are in a state of anarchy. Some states are sponsors of terror. They should not all have a right to decide the future of global security.
1.6. Con: The UNSC contributes to a stable world order.
1.6.1. Pro: There have been no major wars between great powers since the UNSC was formed.
1.6.1.1. Con: Maybe there were no direct wars between major powers, but [many proxy wars have occurred, and many of them were between major powers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_proxy_wars#Cold_War_proxy_wars) and the [Syrian civil war](http://time.com/5162409/syria-civil-war-proxy-battles/) is an ongoing example for that.
1.6.2. Con: The UNSC couldn’t stop [huge list of armed conflicts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ongoing_armed_conflicts), some of them even dating back to 1948.
