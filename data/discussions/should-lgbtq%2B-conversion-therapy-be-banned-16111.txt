Discussion Title: Should LGBTQ+ Conversion Therapy Be Banned?

1. LGBTQ+ Conversion Therapy Should Be Banned.
1.1. Pro: Conversion therapy has been rejected by the majority of medical and mental health professionals.
1.1.1. Pro: Conversion therapies exploit desperate people by offering unrealistic cures and [blame these people](https://www.healthyplace.com/blogs/recoveringfrommentalillness/2015/03/mental-health-and-the-struggle-for-gay-rights) when the treatments fail.
1.1.1.1. Pro: A gay person who has been to conversion therapy may begin a straight relationship after feeling ‘cured’. The individual and their new partner could both be hurt if the ‘cure’ turns out to be a temporary placebo effect.
1.1.2. Pro: [Joseph Nicolosi](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/us/joseph-nicolosi-dead-gay-conversion-therapist.html), a clinical psychologist and pioneer of the conversion movement, was heavily criticized and marginalized within the mental-health profession.
1.1.3. Con: Individuals who have experienced successful conversion therapy report that it was life-changing and extremely positive.
1.1.3.1. Con: This sort of witness testimony exists for many alternative medicinal practices as well. Unless backed by empirical scientific evidence, governments should not formulate policy on the basis of such testimony.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: The mere existence of cases in which people who choose to reject homosexuality in spite of their natural inclinations demonstrate that it is possible to be homosexual, refrain from homosexual actions, and also live a happy and fulfilling life.
1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: "Happy and fulfilling life" is an ambiguous slogan in this case. Somebody who had their arm cut off may also "live a happy and fulfilling life", which doesn't imply that we shouldn't prevent people losing limbs.
1.1.3.2. Pro: Joseph Nicolosi - a qualified psychiatrist - runs a website with [testimonies from his success stories](https://www.josephnicolosi.com/client-stories/), primarily men, who believe themselves 'cured' of homosexual feelings.
1.1.3.2.1. Con: There is no way to verify the accuracy of these testimonies particular as Joseph Nicolosi has an incentive to show that his treatment works.
1.1.3.2.1.1. Pro: Homosexual individuals, who wish to rid themselves of homosexual urges because they find them sinful, have very strong incentives to lie about being cured.
1.1.3.2.2. Pro: There are some self-proclaimed 'ex-gay' people, who are proponents of conversion therapy, stating that the [child abuse](https://www.wwlp.com/news/state-politics/lawmakers-hearing-arguments-for-and-against-conversion-therapy/1043073676) they went through is what initially realigned their sexuality. They are hence grateful for the option of conversion therapy, which allowed them to reconvert back to heterosexuality.
1.1.3.3. Pro: Practitioners believe that people's sexuality can be altered by the [traumatic experiences](https://www.wwlp.com/news/state-politics/lawmakers-hearing-arguments-for-and-against-conversion-therapy/1043073676) one has been through and hence argue that banning conversion therapy will impact people, who have suffered from a traumatic experience that influenced their sexuality.
1.1.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.2.
1.1.3.3.2. Con: According to this logic there should exist a conversion therapy for heterosexual people, for whom homosexual orientation is natural. \(taking into account population sizes and assuming the constant probability of traumatic experiences, more heterosexual people should be undergoing conversion\)
1.1.3.4. Con: This argument suffers from "survivor" bias. It ignores those that it didn't help. In addition, conversion therapy often includes psychologically scarring treatments, making any testimony from a "successfully treated" person akin to a Stockholm syndrome sufferer stating that their captor is good.
1.1.3.5. Pro: [Brady Cone](http://freethinkingministries.com/the-gay-agenda-the-wrong-side-of-hate/) is a popular example of a person who chose to reject his homosexuality. He now spends his life trying to help others do the same.
1.1.3.5.1. Con: A single anecdotal example does not rescue a damaging institutional practice, nor outweigh the negative impact it can have.
1.1.3.5.2. Con: Brady Cone did not undergo conversion therapy, but rather a religion/spiritual awakening. As such, his experience cannot be used to justify conversion therapy as an institution.
1.1.3.5.3. Pro: As he rightly points out, he is a single example of a phenomenon that is known to occur: people who believed themselves to be LGBTQ+ becoming, through therapy or some other means, non-LGBTQ+. If these examples exist, there must be some credence to the theory that conversion therapy works.
1.1.3.5.3.1. Pro: It would be little more than prejudiced erasure to completely ignore the existence of such cases, even if they seem antithetical to known studies or understanding of sexuality.
1.1.3.5.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.1.
1.1.4. Pro: The [American Medical Association](https://www.lambdalegal.org/publications/health-and-med-orgs-stmts-on-sex-orientation-and-gender-identity) has rejected it outright.
1.1.4.1. Con: Medical professionals often have research which is contradicted in years to come; it is possible that conversion therapy could improve and therefore would become medically accepted.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: Bans can be lifted if and when evidence arises proving a procedure to be beneficial or at least not harmful. Until one or both conditions can be met, a ban is warranted.
1.1.5. Pro: Conversion therapy is [fraud](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/04/27/lgbtq-people-were-born-perfect-a-new-bill-would-ban-conversion-therapy-nationwide/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.b48811248cbe) as it offers a cure for a condition which is not recognized as a disease.
1.1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.
1.1.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.
1.1.5.3. Con: The [Oxford English Dictionary](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/disease) defines a disease as "A particular quality or disposition regarded as adversely affecting a person or group of people." Unwanted homosexual desires would certainly meet such a definition.
1.1.5.3.1. Con: Banning conversion therapy clearly eliminates the harms it poses to recipients' mental health. Receiving conversion therapy in no way minimizes the harm of experiencing unwanted homosexual thoughts.
1.1.5.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.1.6. Con: Theoretically, most forms of conversion therapy are based on therapeutic guidelines and [mainstream therapy techniques](https://www.therapeuticchoice.com/why-the-alliance-supports-safe-ther), rather than being a 'made for purpose' entity in itself. As such, it is [no less valid](http://www.brothersroad.org/therapy/) than using mainstream therapy techniques for other illnesses.
1.1.7. Pro: Conversion therapy is no longer part of the medical mainstream; it is affirmatively a [religious practice](https://www.law.ua.edu/lawreview/files/2011/07/Expressive-Ends-Understanding-Conversion-Therapy-Bans.pdf).
1.1.7.1. Pro: Medical professionals and medical associations, for the most part, condemn conversion therapy and the only people, [who still practice it](https://www.law.ua.edu/lawreview/files/2011/07/Expressive-Ends-Understanding-Conversion-Therapy-Bans.pdf), are dissenting therapists, religious ministers or lay counselors.
1.1.7.2. Con: Ministers who practice conversion therapy have the right to hold their own religious beliefs but also to promote their faith to others e.g. through mass, being a televangelist.
1.1.7.3. Pro: Conversion therapy has very [little scientific backing](https://www.law.ua.edu/lawreview/files/2011/07/Expressive-Ends-Understanding-Conversion-Therapy-Bans.pdf); it was initiated by religious ministries. The first ministry was formed by Frank Worthen after hearing God’s voice, which called on Worthen to abandon homosexuality. Hence the therapy has its roots in evangelical Christianity which infuses theology and psychology in their theories and methods.
1.1.8. Con: Simply because something is harmful or ineffective is not a reason to ban something.
1.1.8.1. Con: These are common metrics that governments often use in evaluating a practice as legal and permissible.
1.1.8.1.1. Pro: This seems very counter-intuitive. Bans on illegal drugs are because of the massively harmful effects they have on both individuals and society; conversion therapy similarly has massive deleterious effects to both.
1.1.8.2. Pro: Usually something must invalidate consent or harm third parties in order to necessitate a government ban.
1.1.8.2.1. Con: It is unrealistic to believe that this will be informed consent, as it rarely is when people are [forced into therapy](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/11/14/asia/china-lgbt-conversion-therapy/index.html) \(even when not minors\) by family members.
1.1.8.3. Pro: The same logic applies to a large number of activities which are either medically harmful or at the very least don't work \(e.g. homeopathy\).
1.1.8.3.1. Con: Alternative medicine such as homeopathy is ineffective but not harmful, unlike conversion therapy.
1.1.8.3.1.1. Pro: Conversion therapy in most cases provokes [guilt and anxiety](https://www.tolerance.org/magazine/fall-2012/therapy-of-lies) in people while having little or no potential for achieving changes in orientation.
1.1.8.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.2. Pro: Conversion therapy can have [serious](https://www.sprc.org/news/conversion-therapy-endangers-lgbt-youth-and-must-stop-us-report) [negative](https://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/therapeutic-response.pdf) [effects](https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-whether-conversion-therapy-can-alter-sexual-orientation-without-causing-harm/) on a person's health.
1.2.1. Con: So can having [unwanted homosexual thoughts](https://www.esquire.com/uk/life/sex-relationships/a14379/homosexual-ocd/).
1.2.1.1. Pro: This falls into a strong category of OCD - obsessive thinking and unwanted repetitive thoughts. A [recent study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16905392) suggested that 25% of OCD sufferers experience obsessive sexual thoughts, including concerns of their own sexuality.
1.2.1.2. Pro: People, who have very [strong religious sentiments](https://www.nowtolove.com.au/news/real-life/what-really-goes-on-during-a-gay-conversion-therapy-session-10468), have stated that they have been depressed due to their unwanted sexuality. If they act upon their desires, they end up hating themselves and are ashamed of the sin.
1.2.1.2.1. Pro: It is very difficult for [religious people](https://theconversation.com/some-christian-groups-still-promote-gay-conversion-therapy-but-their-influence-is-waning-91523) to reconcile their non-heterosexuality with their faith. Hence some LGBTQ+ people, with strong religious views, may desperately want to conform to their religion. They may consider conversion therapy their only option to "free" themselves of their homosexuality and to lead what they consider a better life without a prevalent feeling of self- hatred.
1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: The American Psychological Association has endorsed [“sexual identity exploration”](https://www.law.ua.edu/lawreview/files/2011/07/Expressive-Ends-Understanding-Conversion-Therapy-Bans.pdf) therapy. This is a supportive approach aimed at helping religious individuals from the LGBTQ+ community explore a wide range of options, including changing their behaviors, in a nonjudgmental and non-oppressive setting.
1.2.1.2.1.2. Con: This should be a reason for changing religious and social environment, instead of interfering with traits that are natural to an individual.
1.2.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: The curtailment of religious freedom is arguably less important than the protection of the LGBTQ+ community.
1.2.1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: It is inherently the government's duty to protect the marginalized and oppressed in society. Support of these policies actively infringes on the rights and sometime, the physical well being of these community members.
1.2.1.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con: It is also the duty of the government to represent the will of the majority in a society. Therefore, if a majority of people see conversion therapy as a legitimate form of expression, the government ought allow it.
1.2.1.2.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: There are numerous examples of oppressive and regressive social, economic and cultural practices endorsed by the masses that governments have ruled against.
1.2.1.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Governments have ruled against deeply rooted and so called "important" practices like [slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_Abolition_Act_1833) and [sati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sati_\(Prevention\)_Act,_1987) when they have been found to be egregiously violating the rights of state minorities.
1.2.1.2.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Regulating conversion therapy gives it a government endorsement in some cases: suggesting that it is an admissible and ethical practice when subject to restrictions. This is not a stance the government ought be taking.
1.2.1.2.1.2.1.2. Con: Religious views that prescribe conversion therapy are often representative of the majority opinion of that society that the government has been elected to protect.
1.2.1.2.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Most countries [recognise](http://www.billofrightsinstitute.org/founding-documents/bill-of-rights/) that governments have a role to protect minorities even if it goes against the will of the majority.
1.2.1.2.1.2.1.2.2. Pro: Around [half of the UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_United_Kingdom#Statistics) is religious, while [only 2%](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/04/one-in-50-uk-lesbian-gay-bisexual) identify as homosexual.
1.2.1.2.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.2.1.2.2. Pro: Religious members of the LGBTQ+ community often only go for conversion therapy with the aims of [altering their behavior](https://www.law.ua.edu/lawreview/files/2011/07/Expressive-Ends-Understanding-Conversion-Therapy-Bans.pdf) so as to not act on their same-sex desires.
1.2.1.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.1.
1.2.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.
1.2.2. Pro: Practitioners of conversion therapy are [frequently unqualified](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/church-of-england-synod-debate-calls-on-government-ban-gay-cure-therapies-conversion-therapy-a7834216.html).
1.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.1.
1.2.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.2.3. Con: Everyone is free to choose to do things that are harmful. There are a plethora of accepted lifestyles that have a negative impact on someone's health.
1.2.3.1. Con: Even if an individual makes the choice for themselves, they often do so due to being forced by societal pressure of the community in which they live and harassment they face.
1.2.3.1.1. Con: Every single choice one makes is 'coerced' to some extent, either directly through friends / family or through societal pressures as people are coerced into complying with social norms.
1.2.3.1.1.1. Con: While it is true that no choice occurs in a vacuum, the decision to engage in conversion therapy is likely to suffer from a greater intensity of coercion due to the strength of religious people's convictions.
1.2.3.1.1.2. Con: Despite this, society widely recognizes the importance of choice. Therefore, it would be useful to maximize choice in all possible avenues.
1.2.3.1.2. Pro: People in religious societies are made to believe that members and proponents of the LGBTQ+ community are destined for eternal hell and suffering. Hence the choices these people make with regards to things like conversion therapy are [coerced choices](http://time.com/2986440/sexual-conversion-therapy-gay/) at best.
1.2.3.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.
1.2.3.2. Pro: Banning the practice is an overreach because grown adults might be seeking it out and some do report success, although not many. Conversion therapists should instead be required to communicate their success rate over the long term to potential clients so people have accurate information to decide whether or not they would like to participate.
1.2.3.3. Con: There are also a plethora of choices individuals are not allowed to make.
1.2.3.3.1. Pro: The state restricts the ability of individuals to make choices which harm others, as other people do not consent to being harmed \(e.g. banning drink driving\). Conversion therapy has societal harms, as it legitimises homophobia.
1.2.3.3.1.1. Pro: Practitioners are more likely to perpetuate their homophobic beliefs as a form of [marketing](http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2013/02/why-advertising-gay-conversion-therapy-is-like-advertising-make-up/) for their businesses.
1.2.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: If a conversion therapist wants their business to succeed, they need to attract as many people as possible. Therefore, they are incentivised to try and advertise their service so that as many LGBTQ+ people as possible attend.
1.2.3.3.1.1.1.1. Con: It does not make sense to waste money appealing and advertising to a demographic which believes that homosexuality is genetic since they will never pay for conversion therapy.
1.2.3.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: Such advertisement will result in intensifying the already present homophobia in many communities, where conversion therapy is still prevalent. It will hence also make the resistance against the efforts of the LGBTQ+ community in these areas even stronger.
1.2.3.3.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: These therapists will now have more of an active financial incentive to [resist and counter](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2016/11/19/gays-can-be-reformed-just-like-arsonists-trumps-new-domestic-policy-adviser-has-said/?utm_term=.869de0e959ee) any socially progressive change that might lead to more acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community in society.
1.2.3.3.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Anyone who is anti-gay enough to believe in and actively practice conversion therapy is unlikely to act on any socially progressive policy that seeks to give social or financial benefits to the LGBTQ+ community.
1.2.3.3.1.1.1.3. Pro: There may be more than one individual providing these services in an area, so, in like all business, each business is incentivized to out-advertise the other.
1.2.3.3.1.1.1.3.1. Con: The same competitive incentives should also reduce the bigotry of such services as customers are unlikely to see a practitioner who is homophobic when less homophobic alternatives are available.
1.2.3.3.1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: LGBTQ+ individuals who think homosexuality is a sin are likely to have [internalized homophobia](http://www.revelandriot.com/resources/internalized-homophobia/) and perceive any oppression \(whether towards themselves or others\) as deserved.
1.2.3.3.1.1.2. Con: Aggressively targeting demographics within the LGBT+ community who do not want to receive conversion therapy is likely to make practitioners look bad and hence put off LGBT+ individuals who may have been receptive to conversion therapy.
1.2.3.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: Even LGBTQ+ individuals who think homosexuality is a sin and therefore want to receive conversion therapy are likely to be sympathetic to the struggles of the LGBTQ+ community \(since they have shared the same stigma and oppression\). As such they are likely to boycott practitioners who prey upon the LGBTQ+ community.
1.2.3.3.1.1.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.3.1.1.1.3.1.1.
1.2.3.3.1.1.3. Con: The parent falsely assumes the motivation of conversion therapists and their proponents is that they are homophobic rather than caring.
1.2.3.3.1.1.3.1. Con: The intent behind the caring amounts to [homophobia](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/homophobia), because it inherently assumes homosexuality as harmful.
1.2.3.3.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Homophobia, as described by the parents source, is "irrational fear of, aversion to, or discrimination against homosexuality or homosexuals." Even if conversion therapists think homosexuality is harmful, this does not qualify as being homophobic based on this definition.
1.2.3.3.1.1.3.2. Pro: Many Christians believe LGBTQ+ lifestyles conflict with how God designed humans to function. Since under a Christian worldview departing from God’s design causes physical and spiritual harm to people and their communities, one can hardly blame some Christians for not wanting to encourage LGBTQ+ lifestyles. It is literally asking them to support what they believe hurts people.
1.2.3.3.1.1.3.2.1. Con: If God created everything in the world, God also must have created those people who are LGBTQ+. Therefore, the view that LGBTQ+ lifestyles conflict with how God designed humans to function is antithetical to the Christian worldview.
1.2.3.3.1.1.3.2.1.1. Con: Under the Christian worldview, the parent is the equivalent of "God allows humans to sin." This is wholly consistent with the Christian worldview.
1.2.3.3.1.1.3.2.1.2. Con: LGBTQ+ oriented persons, on the Christian worldview, only exist because of the noetic effects of sin. However, these effects are not limited to LGBTQ+ lifestyles. They apply to all lifestyles, actions, or thoughts that depart from God’s design for humans.
1.2.3.3.2. Pro: The state restricts choices an individual can make which may harm themselves, as the state has more information \(e.g. the state knows that education is good so it does not allow parents to not send their children to school\). Conversion therapy harms individuals due to, for example, the mental health problems it creates.
1.2.3.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.
1.2.3.3.2.2. Pro: People who make this choice often do not have full information \(i.e. they believe it is wrong to be LGBTQ+\) so cannot make a fully informed choice.
1.2.3.3.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.2.
1.2.4. Pro: Conversion therapy in many areas comprises of cruel [torture](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/lgbtq-torture-ecuador-conversion-therapy/) techniques.
1.2.4.1. Con: Conversion therapy, in many places, is conducted without employing any cruel techniques. Regulation can ensure that these [safe forms of conversion therapy](https://www.nowtolove.com.au/news/real-life/what-really-goes-on-during-a-gay-conversion-therapy-session-10468) are the only legal ones.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: Conversion therapies in [some churches](https://www.nowtolove.com.au/news/real-life/what-really-goes-on-during-a-gay-conversion-therapy-session-10468) can include practices like praying or developing new relationships with people of the opposite gender. These practices are voluntary.
1.2.4.2. Pro: There have been [cases of three South African men](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/30/gay-south-africa-conversion-deaths_n_3186820.html) dying as a result of starvation and torture at a conversion camp.
1.2.4.3. Pro: Conversion therapies can include [inhumane practice](https://www.ranker.com/list/conversion-therapy-techniques/mike-rothschild)s like chemical castration, exorcism and aversive conditioning.
1.2.4.4. Pro: Use of [shock therapy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/11/14/china-urged-to-stop-using-electroshock-therapy-to-convert-lgbt-people/?utm_term=.8120709f7033) by some groups to "cure" LGBT people is massively harmful and could be banned under regulation.
1.2.4.5. Con: Similar to how potentially dangerous practices are regulated. there are some specific forms of conversion therapy that can be outlawed while still regulating and allowing others.
1.2.4.6. Con: -> See 1.1.6.
1.2.4.7. Con: Regulation can make conversion therapy much less harmful.
1.2.4.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.4.
1.2.4.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.
1.2.4.7.3. Pro: Regulation of who can lead these conversion sessions and what can be down allows conversion therapy to exist in a safer manner.
1.2.4.7.3.1. Pro: Conversion therapy is also legally provided by qualified psychologists to willing clients. These [psychologists](https://www.josephnicolosi.com/) conduct these treatments in a very nonjudgmental and collaborative environment without indulging in any inhumane practices.
1.2.4.7.4. Con: No amount of regulation will change what will happen in a private therapy session.
1.2.4.7.4.1. Pro: It is difficult to enforce regulations as neither the practitioner nor the patient have incentives to report services that do not conform to regulations.
1.2.4.7.4.2. Con: Legal frameworks still provide an outlet for individuals to seek justice against malpractice or fraud, should they feel duped as a result of private therapy sessions.
1.2.4.7.4.3. Con: There is no basis for that claim. Regulations always make a big change in every industry that is regulated.
1.2.4.7.4.3.1. Pro: If both the practitioner and recipient of conversion therapy wish for the therapy to occur, there is no incentive for anyone to report the use of unregulated practices.
1.2.4.7.4.3.1.1. Con: If both the practitioner and recipient are willing and consenting participants in the conversion therapy session, the government has no right to intervene.
1.2.4.7.4.3.1.2. Con: Even participants who desire conversion therapy, are likely to prefer regulated and hence safer forms of conversion therapy. They, therefore, have an incentive to report unregulated practices.
1.2.4.7.4.3.1.3. Pro: Forms of therapy such as electroshock therapy that are likely to be banned under regulation may be perceived as more effective than safer alternatives. Participants may therefore still seek out such restricted therapies.
1.2.4.7.4.4. Pro: Organisations who run conversion therapy do so as they view being gay as something hugely immoral.
1.2.4.7.4.4.1. Pro: This is often motivated by religious views or societal norms, and so organisations will not listen to a government that tells them to do practices that practitioners view as less effective.
1.2.4.7.4.4.1.1. Con: If the other option if a complete ban many of the visible organisations will adhere to regulations to stay doing what they feel is something morally good.
1.2.4.7.5. Con: Something which is said to get safer with regulation is typically illegal and therefore unregulated. Conversion therapy is legal and therefore 'regulated' as it must abide by certain laws, yet it still is harmful.
1.2.4.7.6. Con: The regulation of conversion therapy grants it legitimacy and hence wrongly suggest that it isn't harmful.
1.2.4.7.6.1. Con: There are many harmful activities such as the smoking of cigarettes and consumption of tobacco that are regulated.
1.2.4.7.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.2.1.1.2.
1.2.4.7.6.3. Pro: Regulation of conversion therapy, suggests that within imposed regulations, conversion therapy is medically efficacious.
1.2.4.7.6.4. Pro: Regulation suggests that the outcome of conversion therapy is desirable or at least not undesirable.
1.2.4.7.6.4.1. Con: Conversion therapy is likely to exist in either world - whether it is sanctioned by the government or not. It is better to live in a world where such practices are subject to formal oversight and legal regulations.
1.2.4.7.7. Pro: Increasing current regulation could ensure that consent is always fully given by participants as opposed to family pressures or other social pressures.
1.2.4.7.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.2.
1.2.5. Pro: Practitioners of conversion therapy often [blame family circumstances](https://www.livescience.com/50453-why-gay-conversion-therapy-harmful.html) or choices the individual made as the reason they identify LGBTQIA+.
1.2.5.1. Pro: This can lead to those individuals blaming themselves and suffering from mental health issues.
1.2.5.2. Pro: There is [no known causal link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3535560/) between family circumstances and LGBTQ+ identity.
1.2.5.3. Pro: There are [clear studies](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/is-homosexuality-a-choice/) that indicate that being LGBTQ+ is not exclusively a choice.
1.2.6. Pro: Conversion therapy in a vast majority of cases [does not work](http://longbeachtherapy.com/conversion-therapy-doesnt-work-in-fact-it-causes-irreparable-damage/). Hence a majority of the people who go through conversion therapy are likely to feel extremely [depressed](http://time.com/2986440/sexual-conversion-therapy-gay/) since the therapy forces them to hate their own identities/sexualities without offering any viable alternative.
1.2.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.3.1.1.
1.2.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.
1.2.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.
1.2.6.4. Pro: Sexual Orientation Change Efforts \(SOCE\) has been thoroughly discredited. The World Psychiatric Association - the largest of its kind on earth - said "There is no sound scientific evidence that innate sexual orientation can be changed." With no evidence that SOCE is valid, and plenty of evidence that SOCE is harmful, SOCE should not be considered a valid choice for anyone.
1.3. Con: Banning conversion therapy is not the answer, as it impacts on an individual's decision to seek help for what they perceive as a problem. It should only be prohibited when conducted without consent \(including minors\).
1.3.1. Pro: There are [many](http://www.brothersroad.org/therapy/) [organisations](https://www.therapeuticchoice.com) fighting to keep conversion therapy \(and associated support groups\) legal, on the grounds of free choice.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Banning conversion therapy sends a message that people are not free in their choices of medical treatment which is equally harmful.
1.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.
1.3.1.3. Pro: Certain members of the [LGBTQ+ community](https://www.law.ua.edu/lawreview/files/2011/07/Expressive-Ends-Understanding-Conversion-Therapy-Bans.pdf) believe that banning conversion therapy is troubling, not only because it fails to acknowledge the needs of homosexual individuals who wish to live in according to their religious beliefs. They believe that the community should recognize the need for religious individuals to try and alter their sexuality.
1.3.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.1.
1.3.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.
1.3.2. Pro: People should have the right to make a choice over how they identify and live their life; conversion therapy provides an option.
1.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.
1.3.2.2. Pro: Choice gives people happiness as they can select what works best for them - it is the basis of why we believe freedom to be good.
1.3.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.2.
1.3.2.4. Con: People who are gay, who have been told all their lives by society that being gay is wrong do not have free choice in the matter, as societal pressure and beliefs are likely to be heavily influencing their decision on whether or not to undergo conversion therapy.
1.3.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.
1.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.8.2.1.
1.3.4. Con: -> See 1.2.3.1.
1.3.5. Pro: Many people live in parts of the world which do not accept LGBTQ+ identities. They should be allowed the option of conversion therapy if it means they will no longer face harassment and discrimination, or if they are upset because they must hide a part of their identity.
1.3.5.1. Con: It would be more beneficial to society to "convert" \(though obviously not by the same methods\) those communities into greater understanding and acceptance.
1.3.5.1.1. Con: Many orthodox societies are conservative echo-chambers and have remained regressive for centuries. It is unlikely that such a grass root level change can occur to effect enough benefit to a LGBTQ+ individual living in such an area within one lifetime.
1.3.5.1.1.1. Pro: Regardless of the truth, many people feel being LGBTQ+ is a problem because it does not conform with other identities they might hold close to themselves \(such as cultural, religious etc.\). Conversion therapy might be a useful course of action for such people.
1.3.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.
1.3.5.1.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.2.
1.3.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.
1.3.5.3. Pro: Alongside homophobia and transphobia, sexism is also rampant in society. For transgender women, if they wish to avoid the sexism they would face, they should be allowed to pursue conversion therapy.
1.3.5.3.1. Con: Engaging in conversion therapy to avoid discrimination, signals that LGBTQ+ individuals should be ashamed of their identity and that they and society should not fight oppression that they face.
1.3.6. Pro: Many [practitioners](https://www.wwlp.com/news/state-politics/lawmakers-hearing-arguments-for-and-against-conversion-therapy/1043073676) claim that they do not seek to change people who believe that homosexuality is inborn and only want to help those who actually desire the change.
1.3.6.1. Con: When you spend your career i.e. a significant portion of your life, on changing LGBTQ+ people it is likely you believe you are doing the right thing and that being LGBTQ+ is wrong. Therefore, it is in your incentive to 'treat' as many people as possible.
1.3.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.3.1.1.1.
1.3.6.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.3.3.1.1.2.
1.3.7. Pro: There exists a large body of research that homosexuality is [a major health risk](https://downloads.frc.org/EF/EF08L44.pdf). Thus, conversion therapy should be protected by law because individuals may want to avoid these health risks.
1.3.7.1. Con: The [FRC is anti-LGBT](https://www.frc.org/homosexuality), presenting data in light of their own biases in misleading ways.
1.3.7.1.1. Con: The parent commits the ad hominem fallacy attacking the source rather than the argument itself. Moreover, this data is not from FRC. It is the chapter of a well-known book that FRC has simply placed on their site.
1.3.7.2. Con: There are [professionally approved ways](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/msm/index.html) and programs to combat the particular health risks faced by homosexual men that don't force them to undergo trauma.
1.3.7.2.1. Con: Although condoms are known to be effective in reducing the risk of transmission, high proportions of MSM continue to report non-use or inconsistent use of condoms \(Sanchez et al. 2006; Osmond et al. 2007; Truong et al. 2006; Carter 2007\).
1.3.7.3. Pro: Homosexual men are at increased risk for contracting HIV. In a large CDC study, conducted in sexually transmitted disease \(STD\) clinics in five major U.S. cities, researchers found the rate of new HIV infections among men who have sex with men \(MSM\) to be nine times higher than among women and heterosexual men. Source: “New CDC Studies Shed Light on Factors Underlying High HIV Infection Rates Among Gay and Bisexual Men,” CDC Press Release \( July 9, 2002\).
1.3.7.3.1. Pro: Homosexual youths have an increased risk of contracting HIV. In 2016, youth aged 13 to 24a made up 21% of all new HIV diagnoses in the United States. Most \(81%\) of those new diagnoses occurred among young gay and bisexual men.
1.3.7.3.2. Pro: Anal sex \(intercourse\), which involves inserting the penis into the anus, carries the [highest risk](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/risk/cdc-hiv-anal-sex.pdf) of transmitting HIV if either partner is HIV-positive.
1.3.7.4. Pro: Homosexual men are the [largest risk category](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/statistics/overview/ataglance.html) for AIDS.
1.3.7.4.1. Con: [Pre-exposure prophylaxis](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/prep.html) \("PrEP"\), which involves taking a pill daily, is a particularly noteworthy strategy to prevent the spread of HIV.
1.3.7.5. Pro: Homosexual men, with HIV, are at increased risk for developing other life-threatening diseases like [anal cancer](https://cancer-network.org/cancer-information/gay-men-and-cancer/anal-cancer-hiv-and-gaybisexual-men/), [Hodgkin disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/1637026/), [testicular cancer](https://www.cancer.org/healthy/find-cancer-early/mens-health/cancer-facts-for-gay-and-bisexual-men.html), and [oral cancer](https://lgbtcancer.org/our-cancer-stories/oral-and-anal-cancer/).
1.3.7.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.1.
1.3.7.7. Con: The health risks of homosexuality are largely products of homophobia somewhere down the line, rather than an intrinsic biological problem with homosexuality. For example, a high amount of STDs amongst gay men is very much a result of poor sex education for gay people \(compared to straight people\). Therefore, we cannot use the health risks of homosexuality as an argument when the actual problem there is socially constructed most of the time.
1.3.8. Pro: Affirmation therapy can be just as dangerous as conversion therapy. A balanced approach is needed.
1.4. Con: Without this option many conservative communities may permanently exclude LGBT people.
1.4.1. Con: Conservative communities already exclude LGBT+ individuals. Banning conversion therapy prevents these individuals from having to be subjected to additional homophobia or treatment.
1.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.3.1.1.3.
1.4.2. Con: -> See 1.3.5.1.
1.4.3. Con: Exclusion is often a lesser harm than being forced into conversion therapy.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Exclusion is harmful but largely occurs in terms of stigmatisation and unfriendly comments. This is a lesser harm than forcing someone to undergo dangerous medical practices which harm their long run health and well being.
1.4.3.2. Pro: These communities will not change their homophobic or transphobic views simply because conversion therapy is banned so LGBTQ+ exclusion will happen anyway. At least now, people cannot be forced into conversion therapy.
1.4.3.3. Con: Exclusion often means being kicked out of home or losing access to financial and social support networks which can be detrimental to young people.
1.4.3.4. Pro: Even though it may not be easy, a person can still opt out of an exclusionary environment.
1.4.3.4.1. Pro: A person could change cities, make new friends and find LGBTQ+ members and allies to find new social circles. This is still easier than living with the lifelong physical and mental trauma of conversion therapy.
1.4.3.4.1.1. Con: These are all ways that people could similarly opt out of conversion therapy should their family demand they receive it. It is therefore unclear why it must be banned.
1.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.
1.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.3.
1.4.6. Pro: Often conservative communities force known LGBT people to seek treatment for what they view as a disease. In the short term this view will not change; therefore, allowing LGBT people to go to conversion therapy allows them to stay within those communities.
1.4.6.1. Pro: Many of the most vulnerable in the LGBT community do not have the option to leave their communities due to lack of wealth or opportunities elsewhere; without this treatment they may be excluded from these communities and left with nowhere to go.
1.4.6.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.3.2.
1.4.6.1.2. Pro: According to the Williams Institute, [40%](http://nationalhomeless.org/issues/lgbt/) of the homeless youth served by agencies in major cities identify as LGBTQ+.
1.4.6.1.3. Pro: This could be substantially worse as often conservative communities have no support networks for LGBT people.
1.4.6.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.
1.4.6.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.2.
1.4.6.3. Con: Conversion therapy suggests that being LGBTQ+ is a problem, which is untrue.
1.4.6.3.1. Pro: Being gay is a natural occurrence. Converting someone from their natural state to address your own discomfort is immoral.
1.4.6.3.1.1. Con: Practitioners claim that being LGBTQ+ can be [triggered by environment](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/03/15/homosexuality-may-be-triggered-by-environment-after-birth/) after birth.
1.4.6.3.1.1.1. Con: The beliefs of practitioners are irrelevant, we should only be concerned with what is true.
1.4.6.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Science is not a matter of majority opinion. What 'most people believe' is not how science and medicine should be evaluated; it should be based on objective evidence and experimentation.
1.4.6.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: What is science is constantly changing. There are many questions to which science does not have answers, and even more to which science's answers are changing. Placing absolute faith in science may not always be the best way to go.
1.4.6.3.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The scientific method accounts for flux and uncertainty. Placing faith in science does not mean being ignorant to other possibilities, it means waiting for evidence before supporting those other possibilities.
1.4.6.3.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.1.
1.4.6.3.1.2. Con: Cancer is natural. The occurrence of a condition in nature is irrelevant to whether a person should be able to seek treatment for it in their life.
1.4.6.3.1.3. Pro: Converting someone arguably produces less utility to the converter/conversion supporter than it does suffering to the person who is converted. Therefore, under a utilitarian view, such conversion is immoral.
1.4.6.3.1.3.1. Con: This claim is contingent on the person being converted experiencing suffering. Individuals who desire conversion therapy are likely to gain utility from the experience.
1.4.6.3.1.4. Con: -> See 1.2.3.3.1.1.3.
1.4.6.3.1.5. Con: We convert people from natural behaviors for reasons of discomfort all the time.
1.4.6.3.1.5.1. Pro: We make people engage in codes of conduct such as manners.
1.4.6.3.1.5.1.1. Con: Adhering to small rules such as manners is substantially different than making someone change a large part of their identity.
1.4.6.3.1.5.1.1.1. Con: While there is a difference in the scale of the change, both examples are principally consistent.
1.4.6.3.1.6. Con: Using the same reasoning as the parent: some people feel a natural repulsion to homosexuals. If the parent is true, converting someone from this natural impulse to address a homosexual’s discomfort is immoral. Such reasoning is absurd and unacceptable to the LGBTQ community. Thus it must not be imposed on others. One primary purpose of morality is to restrain our natural impulses for the sake of ourselves and others. Overcoming our “bad” natural impulses is what being moral is all about.
1.4.6.3.1.6.1. Pro: It does not follow that just because a feeling or orientation is natural that it is also moral.
1.4.6.3.2. Pro: By having this therapy legal, people view it as something legitimate and that therefore LGBTQ+ people need to be cured. This furthers the idea that LGBTQ+ people are different and inferior which can lead to more implicit and explicit homophobia.
1.4.6.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.3.1.1.
1.4.6.3.3. Con: -> See 1.3.5.1.1.1.
1.4.6.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.3.1.1.1.
1.4.6.3.5. Pro: Homophobic people have used the existence of conversion therapy as well as accounts of 'ex-gay' people to support their claim that homosexuality is a mutable characteristic and is therefore [undeserving of any legal protection](https://www.law.ua.edu/lawreview/files/2011/07/Expressive-Ends-Understanding-Conversion-Therapy-Bans.pdf).
1.4.6.3.6. Con: Disagreeing with something and banning it are two different things.  We should protect our freedoms to do things that people disagree with.
1.4.6.3.6.1. Pro: Banning conversion therapy interferes with religious freedom.
1.4.6.3.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.
1.4.6.3.6.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.
1.4.6.3.6.1.3. Con: Religious freedom is not absolute.
1.4.6.3.6.1.3.1. Pro: Religion is often restricted when it is deemed to harm individuals or society.
1.4.6.3.6.1.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.
1.4.6.3.6.1.3.1.2. Con: This harm only comes about if people do not have a choice to engage in conversion therapy, which is not the case.
1.4.6.3.6.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.
1.4.6.3.6.1.3.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.4.
1.4.6.3.6.1.3.2. Con: Religion is only restricted when a direct harm is created; the harms associated with conversion therapy are disputed.
1.4.6.3.6.1.4. Con: Freedom of religion grants individuals the right to practice their own religion, not enforce their religious beliefs upon others as conversion therapy involves.
1.4.6.3.6.1.4.1. Con: Conversion therapy may be a necessary part of a religious LGBTQ+ individual's religious practice.
1.4.6.3.6.1.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.
1.4.6.3.6.1.4.1.2. Pro: Many religions believed homosexuality is a sin, engaging in conversion therapy may allow them to avoid committing this sin.
1.4.6.3.6.1.5. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.2.1.
1.4.6.3.6.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.3.1.1.3.2.
1.4.6.3.6.2. Pro: Government support of choice is beneficial to the community. Such support should involve allowing freedom of choice regarding sexuality and medical treatment.
1.4.6.3.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.
1.4.6.3.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.
1.4.6.3.6.4. Con: Conversion therapy is not simply something people disagree with - it is a collection of procedures that either are inherently harmful or are based on legitimately harmful ideas and misinformation.
1.4.6.3.7. Pro: The narrative associated around this therapy is always one of 'fixing yourself' and making your life better.
1.4.6.3.8. Con: It only suggests being LGBTQ+ is a problem if people go to conversion therapy with the view of being 'cured', rather than deciding they simply would not like to be LGBTQ+. The latter doesn't mean they necessarily regard being LGBTQ+ as a problem.
1.4.6.3.8.1. Con: Even when it is not considered a 'cure'; practicing conversion therapy still perpetuates the narrative that sexuality is a choice and can be altered.
1.4.6.3.8.1.1. Con: Practitioners believe that being LGBTQ+ is the result of upbringing rather than biology, and as such, it can be addressed like any other mental health problem.
1.4.6.3.8.1.1.1. Con: The reason we treat mental health disorders is because of the massive harms they have on someone's wellbeing; this is not the case with someone's LGBTQ+ identity.
1.4.6.3.8.1.1.1.1. Con: In extremely conservative parts of the world, being a member of the LGBTQ+ community can be detrimental to someone's well being due to the [oppression and ostracization](https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardianwitness-blog/2014/may/16/whats-it-like-being-lgbt-around-the-world).
1.4.6.3.8.1.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.5.
1.4.6.3.8.1.1.2. Pro: There is some [evidence](https://www.therapeuticchoice.com/research-division) to suggest that LGBTQ+ orientations are not biologically predetermined.
1.4.6.3.8.1.1.2.1. Con: The source provided does not present evidence that sexual orientation is not biologically predetermined, but that sexuality is or can be relatively fluid, which is [already a recognized concept](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-love/a20662770/what-is-sexually-fluid/).
1.4.6.3.8.1.1.3. Pro: Practitioners claim that childhood problems; such as not getting enough attention from parents or suffering from sexual abuse may result in people developing [different gender identities and sexualities.](https://www.nowtolove.com.au/news/real-life/what-really-goes-on-during-a-gay-conversion-therapy-session-10468)
1.4.6.3.8.1.1.3.1. Con: The source does not cite medical practitioners, particularly not where it discusses this abuse- it's just a narrative.
1.4.6.3.8.1.1.4. Con: The beliefs of the practitioners are irrelevant. Most people believe their treatments are effective.
1.4.6.3.8.1.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.4.6.3.1.1.1.1.
1.4.6.3.8.1.1.5. Con: There are studies linking biology to gender identity and sexual attraction.
1.4.6.3.8.1.1.5.1. Pro: A study by [Bailey and Pillard](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/J_Bailey2/publication/21311211_A_Genetic_Study_of_Male_Sexual_Orientation/links/02e7e53c1a72a8a596000000/A-Genetic-Study-of-Male-Sexual-Orientation.pdf) showed concordance in sexual orientation between MZ twins.
1.4.6.3.8.1.1.5.2. Pro: Hamer identified [a genetic marker of male homosexuality.](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stacey_Cherny/publication/15618580_Linkage_between_sexual_orientation_and_chromosome_Xq28_in_males_but_not_in_females/links/579db28808ae6a2882f3be16/Linkage-between-sexual-orientation-and-chromosome-Xq28-in-males-but-not-in-females.pdf)
1.4.6.3.8.1.1.5.3. Pro: Latter born sons are more likely to be gay, not for environmental factors, [but because mothers develop immunity to H-Y antigen](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c152/d0fe2389ffe480e5fc80c178ec0fbef719a1.pdf), which leads to hormonal changes associated with sexual orientation.
1.4.6.3.8.1.1.5.4. Pro: There are [neuro-anatomical](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e177/ef304d4b89cde6e6779568de7a85dabd390f.pdf) and [physiological](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b34d/d06cf53b276af277d6108aadc11935fd01a7.pdf) differences between gay vs. straight men.
1.4.6.3.8.1.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.
1.4.6.3.8.1.1.7. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.3.1.1.
1.4.6.3.8.2. Pro: This is something which could exist when individuals make a fully informed choice to engage in conversion therapy, and don't regard their previous lifestyle as immoral or inferior.
1.4.6.3.8.2.1. Con: The reality is that individuals do not choose to engage in conversion therapy for these reasons but do so because of shame or stigma.
1.4.6.3.8.2.1.1. Pro: If someone was completely content with their identity, they would not feel the need to change it. Necessarily, conversion therapy is saying that to be LGBTQ+ is undesirable.
1.4.7. Con: While it is traumatizing to be excluded from a community, you can join some less conservative community instead. Denying one's own biology likely leaves much deeper trauma.
1.5. Con: -> See 1.4.6.3.6.1.
1.6. Pro: There is precedent for conversion therapy being banned.
1.6.1. Con: If the fact that some jurisdictions have banned conversion therapy is an indication that it is bad, then the fact that other jurisdictions have not banned conversion therapy must be an indication that it is good.
1.6.1.1. Con: A decision not to ban something may be an expression of neutrality. It does not suggest approval, simply a lack of adequate disapproval \(or political will\) to justify legislative change.
1.6.1.2. Con: Freedom is the default position. Something must be proved to meet a significant threshold of harm to be banned. There is no threshold of benefit that must be met for something to not be banned.
1.6.2. Pro: While not explicitly illegal, most EU countries treat conversion therapy as a form of [child abuse](https://www.quora.com/Is-gay-conversion-therapy-for-children-legal-in-Europe).
1.6.3. Pro: 13 U.S. states ban conversion therapy for [minors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._jurisdictions_banning_conversion_therapy_for_minors#Federal).
1.6.4. Pro: Gay conversion therapy is illegal in [Malta](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/07/malta-becomes-first-european-country-to-ban-gay-cure-therapy).
1.6.5. Con: Precedent for something doesn't necessarily mean it is correct. There are plenty of examples of horrible actions which have precedent throughout history and in different places around the world.
1.6.5.1. Con: The discussion here relates to active precedent, not historical precedent.
1.7. Con: Some believe LGBTQ+ lifestyles are immoral. Thus governments should, in fact, protect conversion therapy for the sake of these persons.
1.7.1. Con: Such views are increasingly a minority; with legalisation of [same-sex marriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage), [increased tolerance](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/02/05/more-u-s-teens-identify-transgender-survey-finds/306357002/) and prevalence of gender divergence and/or neutrality, the world is very much moving away from LGBTQ+ orientations being considered immoral.
1.7.1.1. Con: LGBTQ+ orientations are not considered immoral. Most people agree that orientation is natural and it wouldn’t make sense to call a natural inclination immoral.
1.7.1.1.1. Con: LGBTQ+ 'lifestyles' is an incorrect term. It is a sexual orientation. To call it a lifestyle wrongly implies choice where none exists.
1.7.1.1.1.1. Con: Orientations are natural urges and are not chosen. However, actions taken based on natural urges are choices. To act on one’s LGBT orientation is a choice. Therefore, lifestyle is an appropriate term.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Humans have many natural urges that are considered immoral.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Psychopaths have “natural” urges to cause pain in other people. Taking action based on those urges would be immoral.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Some [siblings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incest) have “natural” urges to have sexual relations with one another. To act on these natural urges would be immoral.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Some individuals have a natural inclination to [steal other people’s things](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleptomania). To act on this natural urge would be immoral.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.4. Pro: Some individuals have a natural repulsion and hatred towards the LGBTQ+ community. To take action based on these impulses would be immoral.
1.7.1.2. Con: LGBTQ+ lifestyles can be called immoral because it involves a choice to take action based on these natural impulses.
1.7.1.3. Con: The number of people who hold a belief does not make that belief moral. Otherwise we would have to affirm that when the majority disapproved of LGBTQ+ lifestyles, then the lifestyles were immoral. Popularity does not make right.
1.7.2. Con: Immorality is subjective - dependent on one's belief systems - and should not be used as a basis of legislation for something that is [natural](https://www.exposingtruth.com/homosexuality-is-natural/) and [not a choice](https://www.health24.com/Sex/Sexual-diversity/The-verdict-is-in-homosexuality-is-not-a-choice-20150807).
1.7.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.6.3.1.6.
1.7.3. Pro: It is immoral for government to encourage persons to live in a way that is personally harmful.
1.7.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.
1.7.3.2. Con: Gay and lesbians couples [are happier](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/12/15/gay-and-lesbian-couples-are-happier-than-straight-couples-new-study-reveals/) than their straight counterparts.
1.7.3.3. Con: -> See 1.3.7.7.
1.7.4. Con: -> See 1.7.1.1.1.
1.7.5. Pro: The change in public perception related to LGBTQ+ lifestyles is a result of the sexual revolution of the 20th century. This is very recent making it unclear if this is a moral improvement or degradation.
1.7.5.1. Pro: According to thinkers like [Freud](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosexual_development) and [Kinsey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Kinsey), religious rules about sexuality make people unhealthy, unhappy, and mean. These thinkers and others like Russel, Ellis, and Sanger all pushed these ideas to the forefront.
1.7.5.1.1. Pro: [Kinsey’s reports](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_Reports) had a profound impact on society; however, his methods and results have been deeply criticized.
1.7.5.1.1.1. Pro: Academic [criticisms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_Reports)were made pertaining to sample selection and sample bias in the reports' methodology.
1.7.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: Significant portions of the [samples come from prison populations and male prostitutes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_Reports).
1.7.5.1.1.1.2. Pro: The reports were [based on people who volunteered](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_Reports) to be interviewed about a taboo subject. This likely creates a self-selection bias.
1.7.5.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Psychologist Abraham Maslow asserted that [Kinsey did not consider "volunteer bias"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_Reports). The data represented only those volunteering to participate in discussion of taboo topics. Most Americans at the time were reluctant to discuss the intimate details of their sex lives even with their spouses and close friends
1.7.5.1.1.1.3. Pro: In 1948, the same year as the original publication, a committee of the American Statistical Association, including notable statisticians such as John Tukey, [condemned the sampling procedure](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_Reports). Tukey was perhaps the most vocal critic, saying, "A random selection of three people would have been better than a group of 300 chosen by Mr. Kinsey."
1.7.5.1.1.1.4. Con: In 1979, Gebhard \(with Alan B. Johnson\) published The Kinsey Data: Marginal Tabulations of the 1938–1963 Interviews Conducted by the Institute for Sex Research. Their conclusion, to Gebhard's surprise he claimed, was that [none of Kinsey's original estimates were significantly affected by this bias](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_Reports).
1.7.5.2. Con: Ancient civilisations have recorded instances of homosexuality, which was broadly accepted. It dates back further than the 20th Century.
1.7.6. Pro: Human beings have binary sexuality by nature.
1.7.6.1. Pro: There are biological males and females and that is the overwhelming rule. There are exceptions to this rule but these demonstrate something has gone amiss.
1.7.6.2. Pro: This has been nature’s standard from the beginning because it is the only one that leads to procreation. This has been the foundation of human society since the beginning of human history.
1.7.6.3. Con: This is oversimplistic and factually incorrect: [1.7% of people](https://www.intersexequality.com/how-common-is-intersex-in-humans/) are born intersex, and have been since the beginning of humanity. They are not an example of anything 'amiss'. They are normal, just rarer.
1.7.6.4. Con: This is patently untrue. Divergent sexualities have existed [throughout history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_history).
1.8. Con: Practitioners of conversion therapy believe it is valid, and that it works.
1.8.1. Pro: There are currently no definitive explanations as to why someone is LGBTQ+ and it appears that the factors which determine it may vary over time. If something is created based on the society in which one lives then it can be undone.
1.8.1.1. Con: Even if LGBTQ+ identity is more to do with social construction than biology, that does not mean it can be easily undone by therapy. Social constructions can still create things that are not choices and cannot be easily changed.

1.8.3. Con: -> See 1.4.6.3.8.1.1.4.
1.8.4. Con: There are many branches of alternative medicine that practitioners believe work. However, that is not sufficient reason to have these practices sanctioned by governments.
1.8.4.1. Con: Simply because other practices are not currently banned is not a reason to believe that they should not be. For example, there are [harms](http://www.berkeleywellness.com/self-care/over-counter-products/article/truth-about-homeopathy) associated with homeopathy.
1.8.4.2. Pro: The NHS [voted](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/jun/29/ban-homeopathy-from-nhs-doctors) to ban homeopathy, despite practitioners believing it works.

1.9.3. Con: -> See 1.4.6.3.6.2.
1.9.4. Pro: Conversion therapy promotes a narrative that every time someone does not abide by social norms, they must change at all costs; this can hinder social progression.
1.9.4.1. Pro: Although people with with gender identity issues should seek professional help, conversion therapy being banned sends out a strong liberal message that people are free to be who they want to be. It's a strong statement that it is perfectly okay to be homosexual.
1.9.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.
1.9.4.1.2. Con: This is not necessarily positive to those who disagree with LGBTQ+ lifestyles.
1.9.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.3.1.
1.9.5. Pro: Legalizing conversion therapy allows people to financially benefit from homophobia.
1.9.5.1. Con: Often those who offer conversion therapy do not do it to earn profit \(besides a normal salary\) but believe they are helping people.
1.9.5.1.1. Con: The ability to earn even a normal salary by performing conversion therapy makes it far easier to engage in behaviors that harm the LGBTQ+ community.
1.9.5.1.2. Con: Conversion therapy clinics are very often very [expensive](https://edition.cnn.com/2012/11/29/us/conversion-therapy-response/index.html). They get away with unreasonable fee structures by targeting desperate families and individuals who are willing to bear all costs to change their sexuality/gender orientation.
1.9.5.1.3. Con: The harms that come from these beliefs, no matter how good the initial intention, mean that such treatments ought be banned.

1.9.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.3.1.1.
1.9.6. Pro: Countries like Malaysia actively [promote](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/malaysia-gay-conversion-therapy-endorses-lgbt-rights-islam-a7578666.html) the use of conversion therapy as a way to "fix" being LGBT rather than offer any supports to those in the community.
1.9.6.1. Con: Conservative states like Malaysia have continuously been [criticised](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2018/country-chapters/malaysia) for their stance on LGBT issues.
1.9.6.1.1. Pro: Even if this is true, in more liberal societies people will see donating to conversion therapy clinics as a way to support LGBTQ+ people rather than donating to LGBTQ+ support groups.
