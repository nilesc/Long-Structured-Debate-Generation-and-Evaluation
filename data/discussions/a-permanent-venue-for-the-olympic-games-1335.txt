Discussion Title: A permanent venue for the Olympic Games?

1. The International Olympic Committee \(IOC\) should create a permanent venue for the Olympic Games.
1.1. Pro: A permanent venue would be beneficial for the sport and the athletes.
1.1.1. Pro: The Olympic Games focus international scrutiny on host countries and usually go hand in hand with lots of critical inquiries and bad press that distract from the actual sporting event. A permanent venue would likely prevent that.
1.1.1.1. Con: This emphasizes that sport does not take place in a vacuum and creates awareness for social ills as well as international pressure on the hosting countries.
1.1.1.2. Pro: The 2014 Winter Games in Sochi took place in the shadow of [numerous allegations](https://www.buzzfeed.com/maxseddon/eye-popping-excerpts-from-a-report-alleging-corruption-at?utm_term=.ucA8Jq3q7#.wpJnAegeN) concerning wasteful spending and corruption.
1.1.1.3. Pro: The 2008 Summer Games in Beijing took place [in the shadow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concerns_and_controversies_at_the_2008_Summer_Olympics) of debates about human rights, environmental concerns and censorship.
1.1.1.4. Pro: The 2016 Summer Games in Rio took place in the shadow of concerns about [inequality](https://theconversation.com/rio-2016-olympics-will-be-a-success-but-just-who-will-benefit-56951) and [poverty](https://mic.com/articles/150500/rio-olympics-summer-2016-poverty-tickets-brazilians-cant-afford-income-inequality-rio-de-janeiro#.q6hpMfO2q) as well as [environmental problems](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/27/world/americas/brazil-rio-water-olympics.html).
1.1.1.5. Pro: The 2022 Winter Games in Beijing are already [enveloped in negative press](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/aug/07/2022-winter-olympics-beijing-status-not-snow) about the environmental cost and damage that the location's climate will impose.
1.1.1.6. Pro: The 2020 Summer Games in Tokyo so far made mostly negative news with [allegations of plagiarism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Summer_Olympics#Logo_plagiarism), the [scraping of the plans](https://www.fastcodesign.com/3048786/fast-feed/zaha-hadids-2020-tokyo-olympic-stadium-is-dead) for the new Olympic Stadium due to cost overruns and criticism about [forced relocations](https://www.fastcodesign.com/3030783/japanese-architects-petition-against-zaha-hadids-olympic-stadium-in-tokyo).
1.1.2. Pro: A permanent location could ensure optimum circumstances for the athletes, for example in terms of climate and facilities. This would be in the spirit of athletes performing at their best.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Some cities are barely suitable for Olympic Games due to their levels of pollution, as the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing [illustrated](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/london-2012/5597277/Beijing-Olympics-were-the-most-polluted-games-ever-researchers-say.html).
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: The Beijing marathon routinely makes the news with its [horrible air conditions](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/10/beijings-marathon-marred-by-terrible-pollution/381644/) which even the Chinese government consider unsuitable for any outdoor activity.
1.1.2.2. Con: Climatic conditions are not static at any given location. During the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, for example, the [maximum daily temperatures](https://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/SBRJ/2016/8/5/MonthlyHistory.html?&reqdb.zip=&reqdb.magic=&reqdb.wmo=) varied from 22 to 31 degrees.
1.1.2.3. Pro: Locations like Rio during the last Olympic Games proved to be difficult for certain disciplines. Due to extreme heat, the finishing time of the women's marathon, for example, was almost ten minutes slower than the current world record.
1.1.2.4. Pro: Locations like Rio illustrate how athletes can face distractions due to inappropriate venues, as become evident for the rowers due to the [outright dangerous water quality](http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/international/ct-olympic-rowing-dirty-water-20160806-story.html).
1.1.2.5. Pro: A [recent study](http://news.berkeley.edu/2016/08/11/warming-world-may-put-most-cities-off-limits-for-summer-olympics/) concerning climate change projected that by 2085, only eight North American cities would be suitable hosts for the Summer Olympics
1.1.3. Con: Assuming that a permanent venue creates a permanent host nation, said nation would hold a de-facto "home field advantage" to the detriment of athletes of other nations.
1.2. Pro: A permanent venue would be beneficial for the image of the Olympic Games.
1.2.1. Pro: The bidding process surrounding the awarding of the Olympic Games has been at the center of the [permanent](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/olympics_2012/3939219.stm) [allegations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Winter_Olympic_bid_scandal) [of corruption](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/01/french-police-corruption-investigation-2016-2020-olympic-bids) within the IOC. Getting rid of it would thus wipe away a big stain from the image of the Olympics.
1.2.1.1. Con: This problem is not intrinsic to the bidding process for the Olympic Games, but a problem particular to its administration by the IOC. A corruption-free bidding process is possible.
1.2.1.2. Pro: Taking [bribes](http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv8n2/johv8n2f.pdf) is legally and morally wrong and should not have a place in sports.
1.2.2. Con: Part of what makes the Olympic Games as spectacle is to see how different nations host them and present themselves in the course, for example through the opening ceremony. This element of the Olympic Games would vanish.
1.2.2.1. Con: A permanent venue would not necessarily make this impossible. The Olympic Games could be 'hosted' by alternating countries taking charge of its organization.
1.3. Pro: Creating a permanent venue is sensible regarding financial costs and space.
1.3.1. Pro: There are already enough [deserted](http://www.businessinsider.de/abandoned-olympic-venues-around-the-world-photos-2015-8?r=US&IR=T) Olympic venues all over the world - and no need to continue with the current wasteful practice.
1.3.1.1. Con: A permanent venue would equally result in deserted venues as disciplines are routinely added to and taken out of the Olympic Games.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: Only about a dozen sports have been [removed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games#List_of_Olympic_sports) from the Olympics in the past hundred years, and even some of the temporarily-removed events like [wrestling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_at_the_Summer_Olympics) and [baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_at_the_Summer_Olympics) have already been restored.
1.3.1.2. Con: Olympic venues in ruin are no inevitability. As the case of London [shows](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/davehillblog/2015/jul/23/london-olympic-legacy-three-years-on-2012-games), many of them can be re-purposed and become vibrant parts of their larger communities.
1.3.1.3. Con: Certain Olympic venues, as the example of [Beijing's Water Cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_National_Aquatics_Center#Later_use) illustrates, can be re-purposed to serve the general public.
1.3.2. Pro: The cost of building new facilities and stadiums is a huge burden for each respective host country and its citizens.
1.3.2.1. Con: Applications for hosting, organizing and financing the Olympic Games are voluntary.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: More often than not, the actual burden is not clear \(or at least not visible\) at the time the decision is made. Cost estimates are usually overtly optimistic and the average Olympic Games turn out to be [almost twice as expensive](http://eureka.sbs.ox.ac.uk/4943/1/SSRN-id2382612_\(2\).pdf) as projected.
1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: Governments have easy access to studies, like the one referenced above. Thus they know what they are getting involved with when making the decision. Munich, for example, [rejected](http://m.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Munich-s-2022-Olympic-bid-rejected-in-referendum_15421825) the 2022 Olympic bid due to high costs and environmental concerns.
1.3.2.2. Pro: Corruption flourishes in the run-up to Olympic Games. In the past, the money flows surrounding venues, facilities and infrastructure came under scrutiny, as the examples of [Rio](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-olympics-rio-corruption-exclusive-idUSKCN0YG2WT) and [Sochi](https://www.buzzfeed.com/maxseddon/eye-popping-excerpts-from-a-report-alleging-corruption-at?utm_term=.fp0bQeme6#.slrlyO3OP) illustrate.
1.3.2.3. Pro: According to a [study](http://www.pressreleaserocket.net/study-from-oxford-said-reveals-that-rio-2016-is-set-to-incur-1-6-billion-cost-overrun/467771/) from the Saïd Business School at the University of Oxford, all modern Olympic Games have come in over budget, roughly half of them exceeding their budget by over 100%.
1.3.2.4. Pro: Construction for the Rio Olympics [displaced](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/for-the-displaced-of-rio-the-olympics-has-nothing-to-do-with-our-story/2016/08/07/da16b0e8-5c9a-11e6-8e45-477372e89d78_story.html) 60,000 residents.
1.3.2.5. Con: A single, permanent venue would require regular maintenance and would need to be updated as the [IOC approves new sports](https://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-approves-five-new-sports-for-olympic-games-tokyo-2020) for the Games.
1.3.3. Con: Creating a permanent venue would be financially unprofitable for the IOC. Currently it has a [bidding system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bids_for_Olympic_Games) in which different cities bid to host the games. This is an additional income opportunity for the IOC.
1.3.3.1. Con: Money could be collected otherwise by the IOC, e.g. by introducing a distributed participation fee that comprises of a small percentage of each attending state's gross national income \(GNI\).
1.3.3.2. Con: The IOC [generates](https://www.olympic.org/ioc-financing-revenue-sources-distribution) 47% of its income from selling broadcast rights, 45% from sponsorship rights, and another 5% from ticket sales. None of these income sources would be harmed by hosting the Olympic Games at a permanent venue.
1.3.3.3. Pro: Bid committees must pay an [application fee](http://teacher.scholastic.com/activities/athens_games/backyard.htm) to the IOC. The fee for hosting the 2012 Olympics was $150,000 U.S.
1.3.3.3.1. Con: This application fee is an irrelevant drop in the bucket. The IOC made more than [3.4 Billion Dollars](http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2013/08/26/Olympics/IOC-revenue.aspx) in revenue from the 2012 Olympic Games in London. The application fees of the [nine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bids_for_Olympic_Games#Summer_Olympics_bids) applicant cities amount to less than 0.1% of that.
1.3.4. Con: The problem with a permenant venue is it would only be used for the Olympics three weeks every four years, you cannot have the facilities remaining empty the rest of the team, the financial cost of that alone would be tremendous.  Who would be responsible for the upkeep?  Also these world class venues only stay world class for maybe 10 years as advances in sports happen. So there would be constant renovation needed.
1.4. Con: There is more excitement when athletes from the host country are competing for a gold medal. This excitement would be lost in a neutral setting.
1.4.1. Con: This excitement can turn into [nasty favoritism](http://mashable.com/2016/08/18/rio-crowd-boos/#S78HEeGEIaqB) by the audience, as the Olympic Games in Rio illustrated. This goes against the principles of fairness and equal treatment.
1.4.2. Pro: The notion of "home" and "away" teams are a stable of sports everywhere.
1.5. Con: Creating a permanent venue would lead to a permanently unfair situation.
1.5.1. Pro: No African country has ever hosted Olympic Games - and [none ever would](http://www.wired.com/2016/08/olympic-cities-everywhere/) under a permanent-host plan.
1.5.1.1. Con: This is another reason why the IOC should create a permanent venue. As of right now the process of accepting the tender is without a doubt discriminatory towards poor countries. In that case it is better to agree on one venue that can be shared equally.
1.5.2. Pro: One nation would always be in the spotlight for Olympic events, which would not be accepted by all the others being left out.
1.5.2.1. Con: If the event were not to change every year, TV coverage etc would not be reporting about the marvelous buildings that have been constructed etc, but it would rather just be about the sports and less about the spectacle.
1.6. Con: A permanent venue is not compatible with the spirit of the Olympic Games.
1.6.1. Pro: A permanent venue would be favorable to one country and therewith violate the Olympic spirit of non-discrimination.
1.6.1.1. Pro: The process of finding a permanent venue would inevitably fall prey to complaints about discrimination in terms of geography, climate and time zones.
1.6.1.1.1. Pro: Regardless of where the permanent venue is situated, a large chunk of the world's population would have to permanently watch the events in the middle of the night.
1.6.1.1.2. Pro: Regardless of where the permanent venue is situated, certain nations would show up with fewer supporters due to their geographic distance from the location of the venues.
1.6.1.1.3. Con: The principle of non-discrimination of [Olympism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympism) only states that the enjoyment of rights and freedoms to practice sport should take place without discrimination of any kind. This is not affected by creating a permanent venue.
1.6.1.2. Con: In order to assuage at least some complaints about discrimination, the Olympic Games could take place in a number of rotating permanent venues on different continents.
1.6.1.3. Con: The new permanent venue could be situated in a somewhat reclusive spot, for example a remote Greek island used only for this purpose, that is not right in the center of any nation.
1.6.1.3.1. Con: Having a permanent venue on a Greek island treats Greece favorably as they will receive more incoming tourists, prestige, etc..
1.6.1.3.1.1. Con: At the same time, Greece would incur large-scale costs  for the upkeep of the venues and the necessary infrastructure.
1.6.1.3.1.1.1. Con: There is no reason Greece should pay for such things on their own. Such costs can be paid with participating countries' memebership fees.
1.6.1.3.2. Pro: By choosing a remote Greek island for this purpose, Greece could also ease its debt crisis by selling the land to become property of the IOC.
1.6.1.3.3. Con: Having a single venue leads to inequalities in traveling time for contestants from far away. This violates the principle that all contestants are to be treated equally.
1.6.1.3.3.1. Con: This has not been a problematic issue in comparable international sports events such as [Wimbledon](http://www.topendsports.com/events/tennis-grand-slam/wimbledon/index.htm), [The Masters](http://www.topendsports.com/events/golf-majors/masters/index.htm) golf tournament or the [Tour de France](http://www.topendsports.com/events/tour-de-france/index.htm).
1.6.1.4. Con: -> See 1.6.1.1.3.
1.6.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.3.3.
1.6.1.6. Pro: Strong states, such as [Russia](http://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/36878983), have more influence over the IOC than small states. Thus, venue selections would be undermined by power differentials among states.
1.6.2. Pro: A permanent venue goes against the spiritual basis of the [Olympic Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games) as being an international sporting event.
1.6.2.1. Con: Even historically the international element of the Olympic Games lies in the origin of the athletes, not in the changing locations.
1.6.2.2. Con: A permanent venue could still embody the international factor, for example by having different countries decorate the facilities or even organize the events. The permanent facilities would thus be [rented out](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/news/11779838/Lets-just-pick-one-country-to-host-the-Olympics-permanently.html).
1.6.2.3. Pro: When the French intellectual Pierre de Coubertin revived the Olympics in the 19th century, the intention to [rotate](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/08/rio-olympics-permanent-host/494264/) the competition among European and American cities, was an effort to promote “peace” and an “international” spirit.
1.6.2.4. Pro: 'Globetrotting' Olympic Games enable the hosting countries to showcase themselves as prosperous and being able to keep up with the others economically as well as culturally.
1.6.2.5. Pro: 'Globetrotting' Olympic Games have a greater multicultural appeal.
1.6.3. Con: The original spirit of the Olympic Games has been overcome where necessary or beneficial. The participation of women, for example, was [seen as](http://library.la84.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/2000/OREXXVI31/OREXXVI31za.pdf) "impractical, uninteresting, unaesthetic and improper" until a century ago.
1.6.4. Con: The spirit of the Games is fairness and Sportsmanship. Fairness was violated when the Games were uprooted from the founding country, Greece. Now has become a game of financial gain for a third party the IOC.
1.7. Con: Hosting the Olympic Games is often a symbol of societal advancement and arrival of the nation as peer on the global stage.
1.7.1. Con: In recent years, bidding for and hosting the Olympic Games has, to the contrary, become [associated with](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/07/29/why-democracies-dont-want-the-olympics-anymore/?utm_term=.bdf53045c124) countries that are stuck with authoritarian regimes, human rights violations as well as corruption, and thus with the opposite of societal progress.
1.7.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.1.
1.7.3. Pro: For Japan in 1964, Korea in 1988, and China in 2008 hosting the Olympics was seen as symbolic mark as being part of the club of advanced nations.
1.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.4.
1.7.5. Con: The point of the Olympic Games is to bring athletes from all over the world together, not to be a showcase for countries' spending power.
1.8. Pro: It would be a great opportunity to return the games to Greece.
1.9. Con: Olympic venues serve as an initial push for developing rural areas and city infrastructure.
1.9.1. Con: Olympic building projects are oftentimes way more expensive than necessity dictates. The scrapped Olympic Stadium for the 2020 Summer Games in Tokyo would have cost [70% more](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35158004) than the new, cheaper stadium now in planning.
1.9.2. Pro: The [1972 Munich Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_U-Bahn) facilitated the construction of a subway.
1.9.3. Pro: The [2018 Pyeongchang Olympics](https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1029081/pyeongchang-2018-confident-high-speed-railway-link-will-be-ready-and-properly-tested-before-winter-olympics-open) facilitate a railroad link from the eastern to the western coast of South Korea.
1.9.4. Con: Olympic Games have also led to expensive infrastructure projects that merely serve as a cover for corruption and are otherwise useless, for example the now-dormant [railway line](http://www.citylab.com/commute/2015/02/the-sochi-light-rail-is-the-most-epic-failure-in-olympic-history/385580/) and the [highway](http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2014/02/07/sochi-olympic-price-tag-soars-critic-slams-road-that-could-have-been-paved-with.html) to Sochi built for the 2014 Winter Games.
1.10. Con: A permanent venue comes with the risks associated with relying on one nation. Political strives and economic crises could thus become a threat to the Olympic Games.
1.10.1. Con: A neutral location for a permanent venue would actually be likely to prevent [boycotts](http://matadornetwork.com/sports/a-history-of-boycotts-of-the-olympic-games/) like they have taken place several times in the past, for example during the Cold War. Hence, Switzerland [was proposed](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/01/opinion/01altekruse.html?_r=0) as a possible location.
1.10.2. Pro: An economic crisis like Greece - one of the likely locations as a permanent venue - experienced it, would make the expenses linked to hosting the Olympic Games hard to stomach and difficult to sell. When [a quarter](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/business/international/greece-debt-crisis-euro.html) of the population is out of work and GDP [shrinking](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?locations=GR), other issues are more relevant.
1.11. Pro: With the creation of a permanent venue, the Olympic Games would find its way back to its ancient origin and thus connect with its initial roots.
1.11.1. Con: Except by name, the Modern Olympic Games have nothing much to do with the [Ancient Olympic Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Olympic_Games). They were not international beyond the Greek city states, excluded women and slaves, and had mostly different disciplines.
1.11.2. Pro: The [Ancient Olympic Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Olympic_Games) were held in the same location on the Peloponnese \(Greece\) for almost 12 centuries, beginning in 776 B.C.
1.12. Pro: Holding a big international sporting event in the same location is already well-established in some areas, e.g. [Tour de France](http://www.topendsports.com/events/tour-de-france/index.htm) or [The Championships, Wimbledon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Championships,_Wimbledon).
1.12.1. Con: The examples given are traditionally linked to a specific location, as their name suggests. The modern Olympic Games, regardless of their name, are not.
1.13. Con: The Summer and Winter Games are distinctly different. A permanent venue would need to accommodate both sets of seasonal sports.
1.13.1. Con: Separate permanent locations for Summer and Winter games could be designated.
1.13.2. Con: A number of potential locations would likely be able to accommodate both sets of sports, for example Switzerland.
