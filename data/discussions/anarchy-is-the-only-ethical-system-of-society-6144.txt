Discussion Title: Anarchy is the only ethical system of society.

1. Anarchy is the only ethical system of society.
1.1. Pro: Coercion is always unethical and governments are by nature coercive.
1.1.1. Pro: Individuals do not have the right to coerce others. Therefore, it is also unethical to delegate coercion to others under the label of "government."
1.1.2. Con: There are situations where coercion and violence, outside of self defense, seem morally justified.
1.1.2.1. Con: Coercion in most cases is done under selfish actions and motivations.
1.1.2.2. Pro: If a person has a virulent and dangerous disease it seems justified to use force to contain and treat that person, against their will, even though they haven't harmed anyone or initiated aggression.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: Passively spreading an infectious disease harms people and is a violation of their rights. This is an act of aggression regardless of intent.
1.1.2.2.2. Con: Containing the infectious person is partially done in self-defense, which is justifiable in anarchy.
1.1.3. Pro: People either interact with each other voluntarily or coercively. Governments, by definition, are coercive because they assume ownership over the lives of individuals on the basis that "we are the government". Individuals left to their own devices act to achieve their goals, and do not need to be under the control of involuntary rulers.
1.1.3.1. Pro: -> See discussion #6835: All human interaction should be voluntary
1.1.3.2. Con: Government is voluntary for those who express their consent by voting, and if a majority vote the same, society as a whole consents to its power.
1.1.3.2.1. Con: Government is not voluntary. You may abstain from voting, but you cannot abstain from being subject to the laws of a government.
1.1.3.2.2. Con: Even if 99% of a society decided to violate the rights of 1% of its members, the rights of the 1% remain violated. Consent only exists at an individual basis. No member of society can decide the will of another.
1.1.3.3. Con: The capability of people to interact coercively creates the necessity for a government. An anarchic community might be temporarily sustainable, but will be replaced by people acting coercively at some point in time. An ethical government should minimize the coercion its people have to suffer.
1.1.4. Con: Coercion if used to minimize avoidable human suffering seems ethical.
1.1.5. Con: There is no alternative to coercion. Governments use one method \(force and threats of force\), businesses and individuals use another \(psychological coercion\).
1.1.6. Con: The theft, murder, rape, etc. that exists now and would exist in greater abundance in an anarchic system would effectively be the war, tax and abuse that states are blamed for. Coercion is not limited to modern governments but will also exist in any proto-government be it a tribe, a gang, a or corporation. No plausible mechanism to prevent abuse has been proposed that depends on or is any way related to anarchy.
1.1.6.1. Con: Governments are not the only way to prevent these problems, and in fact do very little to prevent them when there is a lack of culture/societal values to do so.
1.2. Con: Government is a requirement for valuable cooperative endeavours that would be impossible in an anarchic society.
1.2.1. Pro: Without a centralized military and consistent foreign policy, anarchist communities will be unable to protect their members from foreign threats.
1.2.1.1. Con: An anarchist community may be unable to protect itself, but that is not an ethical argument. The anarchist community can still be more ethical than any government.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: If an anarchist community will be unable to protect itself, then implementing anarchism is the same as handing control of the community to a random hostile governing body, which is not ethical.
1.2.1.1.2. Con: Ethical dilemmas should not be blind to reality, otherwise ethics and morality lose all value.
1.2.1.2. Pro: In the real world, there are other peoples out there concentrated into societies and governments. A people living under anarchy will be defeated and brought into an existing government.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: Groups of people have defended themselves from violent neighboring groups effectively through history, often even in spite of support of the opposing factions by governments \(including their own\) without a government structure.
1.2.1.3. Con: Anarchy is not hindered to build up military structures it needs to defend itself \(e.g. [attackthesystem.com](https://attackthesystem.com/national-defense-and-foreign-policy/)\).
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: While ultimately defeated, the big role the Anarchist movement played in the Spanish Civil War supports this claim. [anarchocommunism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-communism#The_Spanish_Revolution), [Revolutionary_Catalonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Catalonia)
1.2.1.4. Con: Centralized militaries have been defeated by voluntary opposition forces countless times throughout history. There is no reason to believe that anarchist communities could not cooperate similarly.
1.2.2. Pro: Anarchy doesn't allow for those with wealth to provide the positive effect to society.
1.2.2.1. Con: Anarchy doesn't prevent those with wealth from providing a positive effect on society.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Currencies are not distributed and backed up with trust.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: Currencies such as gold and silver can be distributed without trust. These are resources that are scarce, take work to produce or obtain, and the materials can be authenticated due to their inherent physical and chemical properties. There are many materials like this and access to enhanced levels of technology increases our ability to use other types of materials as currency.
1.2.2.2.2. Con: All [fiat currencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money) are distributed and backed up with trust. Other forms of currency, such as [cryptocurrencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) do not require trust, they only require sufficient adoption by those engaged in trade.
1.2.2.3. Pro: Banks will not lend out money when they cannot ask for guarantees to get the money back.
1.2.2.3.1. Con: Contract law still applies within anarchy, including the right to choose rules, the right to choose adjudicators, and the right to choose enforcers. There are many methods of insurance and debt collection that do not require government. However, banks do need to be careful about making insurable loans, since the greater the risk, the more expensive the insurance.
1.2.2.3.1.1. Con: Laws may apply in anarchy but because there is no one to enforce them they become meaningless.
1.2.2.3.2. Con: Considering the instability that large scale banking industries produce, as in the cases of The [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression) and the many depressions and recessions that led up to it, and also the [financial crisis of 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008), we may be far better off living within a system that prevents banking and lending services from growing to a large scale.
1.2.2.3.3. Con: Loans would still be made but would only occur between parties that have a high level of trust between each other, as in the case of localized economies. This would have the side effect of forming networks with much higher levels of trust between parties and excluding parties from the network that cannot be trusted. Money is lent on the trust and if the lender loses some money that is a loss that gets absorbed, violence doesn't enter the picture.
1.2.2.4. Con: Anarchy does not prevent agreements between parties, which define the consequences, to be enforced by the aggrieved party, should the terms of the contract be breached.
1.2.2.5. Con: Anarchy enables totally free markets. This enables financial actors to be most beneficial without the hindrances of regulation or taxation.
1.2.2.5.1. Con: Not all versions of anarchism enable free markets, [anarcho-capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-capitalism) does. However, all other forms of anarchism see capitalism as an evil just as oppressive as the state and thus oppose both. [Bakunin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Bakunin), [Chomsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky), [Tolstoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy), [Kropotkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kropotkin) etc. would all oppose free markets and support commonly owned wealth because markets are as immoral as the state.
1.2.2.5.1.1. Con: A anarchic society where there is an institution dedicated to prohibiting people from trading voluntarily is simply not anarchic.
1.2.3. Con: Endeavours can act as rally points themselves. Anything perceived valuable will attract volunteers and their resources.
1.2.3.1. Pro: [SpaceX](http://www.spacex.com/) is a private company pushing space exploration forwards - area previously advanced solely by governments.
1.2.3.1.1. Con: SpaceX is receiving [government funding](http://qr.ae/TUTglf).
1.2.4. Pro: Large infrastructure projects like roads, highways, and monuments are beyond the reach of anarchic societies.
1.2.5. Con: Government is not necessary nor sufficient to induce valuable cooperative behavior.
1.2.5.1. Pro: Ideology can be a motivating force.
1.2.5.2. Con: A framework must exist to coordinate the efforts of any community or else they will often be at odds with each other. Look at the evolution of warfighting as an example. Modern militaries are not hierarchical just for accountability, they are more efficient that way, meaning fewer lost lives, less resources invested, and more consistent results. If each soldier acted on their own in their own time, they would be free from tyranny, but ineffective compared to other more organized militaries.
1.2.6. Con: "Valuable" in this context is propably synonymous with profit. At the latest with industrialisation it becomes obvious that fiat money shall not be the prime mover of society, since it is not eatable.
1.2.7. Pro: In anarchy there is nothing to promote responsibility.
1.2.7.1. Con: The individual conscience will always exist to promote responsible behaviour. Only those who lack one tend to need external compulsion to do the right thing. 'Good people don't need laws to do the right thing and bad people don't respect them anyway.'
1.2.7.2. Con: The phrase "In anarchy there is nothing to promote responsibility" is a false claim: individuals can and do assume responsibility of their own volition in any system. While it is true that there is no coercion or other pressure imposed from the system, a member of an anarchistic society can see a need and fulfill it similarly to how parents and mentors do so now. Coercion is not a necessary and sufficient condition for good behavior. See [c4ss.org](https://c4ss.org/content/14711) for a further discussion of this point.
1.2.7.3. Con: [Reputation](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/reputation) promotes responsibility in anarchy as well as any other type of society.
1.2.8. Con: Rather than maintaining peace, the very violent history of state warfare, both externally, between states, and internally, by the ruling classes of states on subject classes in the form of class warfare, indicates that perpetual warfare is the default conditions of state as a political formation per se.
1.3. Pro: Governments violate [natural rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_and_legal_rights) that all persons possess. In anarchy those rights are realized.
1.3.1. Con: Without institutions there is nothing that can guarantee natural rights.
1.3.1.1. Con: Goodwill is all that is needed to protect natural rights. The methods governments use to protect them simply subvert natural rights, such as the violence of imprisonment.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: This doesn't work when societies grow bigger and loose touch with one's "neighbours". What works in small tribes doesn't work when talking about millions of people.
1.3.1.2. Con: This proposition implicitly assumes that this "institution" has to be a state. In fact, most contractual relationships in society are private. This includes the concepts of private property \(50,000 years ago\) and families \(30,000 years ago\) way before the first institutions that slightly resemble states \(8,000 years ago\).

1.3.1.3. Con: There are plenty of state-independent forces that protect an ethical society with natural rights.
1.3.1.3.1. Pro: Because the motivations of morality are a [subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_psychology) of [active](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_of_morality) [academic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normative_ethics#Motivating_morality) study, the understanding of what motivates ethical behaviour continues to evolve independently of state actors.
1.3.1.3.2. Pro: A reason to be ethical is when being ethical is a default heuristic, as suggested by behavioral psychology.
1.3.1.3.3. Pro: A reason to be ethical is self-interest when ethical societies are perceived as leading to more wellbeing.
1.3.1.3.4. Pro: Two related reasons to be ethical include social pressure and family values.
1.3.1.4. Con: A judiciary system \(private or not\) doesn't constitute a state. States are defined by the monopoly of coercion in a territory. A judiciary system that either is not a monopoly, doesn't have a monopoly on the application of their decisions, or allows people to secede, is not a state.
1.3.2. Con: Nobody knows or can prove what "natural rights" are, or that all people are created "equal". These are very vague and subjective statements and it is best to refrain from using them in a rational argument.
1.3.2.1. Con: "[Normative ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normative_ethics)" is a field that has been rationally studying these issues for over 2000 years, and suggests frameworks for defining natural rights.
1.3.2.2. Con: The impetus is upon those favoring government to prove an ethical or moral right for one or more individuals to engage in involuntary compulsion over another individual or group. The right to rule is no less an unwarranted assertion than the existence of natural rights.
1.3.2.3. Con: The State predicts that all people are equal and, therefore, must be fitted in laws such as "you shall not smoke or sell weed". There is no way to predict what all people want and, even if it was possible, the information would always be out of date.
1.3.2.4. Con: Natural rights are the right to own your body and, in extention, your possessions and treat them as you please, as long as not attacking others.
1.3.3. Pro: Anarchy believes in [many kinds of social equality](http://www.earlhamsociologypages.co.uk/Anarchismequal.doc) by default, whereas other ideologies do not.
1.3.4. Con: A utopian Communist Government is more ethical than an anarchic society.
1.3.4.1. Pro: The brutally individualistic landscape of anarchy leads to [Social Darwinism](https://www.allaboutscience.org/what-is-social-darwinism-faq.htm).
1.3.4.2. Con: This statement comes from an oversimplification of both the landscapes of communism and anarchism. "Darwinistic" anarchy isn't the only flavor available and communism \(generally recognized as state led\) has been subject to several [well noted abuses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity_under_Communist_regimes).
1.3.4.2.1. Pro: [Anarcho-syndicalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-syndicalism) is an example of an anarchic system not subject to vicious [Social Darwinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Darwinism).
1.3.4.3. Con: Utilitarian communism is unworkable unless the vast majority of the population are ideologically committed to the virtues of industry and thrift, that is to say, contributing more than they take in terms of resources unless the resources are inexhaustible.
1.3.4.4. Con: All forms of communism are unethical unless voluntary \(e.g. anarcho-syndicalism, which is still anarchic\) because they violate [private property rights](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs201/projects/2007-08/communism-computing-china/intelproperty.html).
1.3.5. Pro: In anarchy one can defend oneself against any threat without being constrained by written rules.
1.3.5.1. Con: Commonly, fear of crime is [unproportionally high](http://criminology.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264079.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264079-e-10) compared to the likelihood of being the victim of a crime. If people illogically assess threats, unconstrained self defense could lead to more unnecessary violence.
1.3.6. Pro: Maximized individual liberty is most ethical. Therefore, a system in which everyone may do anything they please, except violate the rights of others, is most ethical.
1.3.6.1. Con: It's far from clear that maximised individual liberty is the most ethical state of affairs. Alternative situations with different degrees of liberty may prove more ethical.
1.3.6.2. Con: A person's rights can easily conflict with individual liberty.
1.3.6.2.1. Pro: The right to follow your religious beliefs [often conflicts](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/nov/03/conflicting-rights) with the right of others not to face discrimination.
1.3.6.2.2. Pro: The pursuit of equality, in order to maximise the liberty of the least well off, often [conflicts](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/gUeuGWflfbfmqpR4OqkYSN/The-conflict-between-liberty-and-equality.html) with the liberty of others.
1.3.6.3. Pro: This is intuitively appealing, the idea that people should be left to do what they want if they don't interfere with the lives of others.
1.3.6.4. Con: There exists no objective standard against which to measure what is most or least ethical. The selection of all such ideals or standards, while not arbitrary, is nevertheless subjective.
1.3.6.5. Con: Many people get hurt in anarchy that wouldn't get hurt under a stable government.
1.3.6.5.1. Con: Most of the damage is self-inflicted, whereas in statist society oppressors harm nearly everyone. The freedom to defend oneself against harm puts the ability to avoid harm in the hands of every individual, whereas the state systematically harms almost everyone and leaves them helpless without recourse.
1.3.6.5.2. Con: This is irrelevant to the proposition that "anarchy is the only ethical system of society" because "no one getting hurt" is not a premise for rational ethics. In fact, the most important application of ethics is to define what's better when preferences of people are in conflict.
1.3.6.5.2.1. Con: "No one getting hurt" Is a straw man argument. It is in quotes but no one has stated that it is a reasonable criteria for government to enforce.
1.3.6.5.3. Pro: Although government inherently violates the rights of ordinary people, the absence of government would lead to greater violation of rights due to lawless individuals dominating peaceful ones. Therefore, a monopoly on the violation of rights in the form of government is more ethical than the alternative, and may through representative or democratic means be more benevolent than those with no one to answer to.
1.3.6.5.3.1. Con: Highly respected social norms likely pre-dated concepts of states.
1.3.6.5.3.1.1. Pro: Pre-state societies may well have been very [egalitarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_communism).
1.3.6.5.3.2. Pro: Without a government to protect the weak from the tyranny of the strong, there will be no such protection.
1.3.6.5.3.2.1. Con: Self-defense, community defense, and private security provide all the protection that is necessary. Charity can provide for this where personal ability fails.
1.3.6.5.3.2.2. Con: Government is itself a strong tyrant that only the very elite are protected from.
1.3.6.5.3.2.2.1. Con: Governments follow through on laws they set for themselves. Those laws are applicable to all equally.
1.3.6.5.3.2.2.2. Con: Governments provide protection to the weak, such as providing shelters for orphans or the homeless.
1.3.6.5.3.2.2.2.1. Con: Historically speaking, many governments been apathetic, at best, towards the plight of the weak.
1.3.6.5.3.2.2.2.2. Con: [Historically](https://warisboring.com/when-patton-rolled-tanks-over-veterans-in-washington-d-c/), governments protect the wealthy/ruling class. More money is spent on convincing the general populace to [ignore the needy,](https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/18835905_10208203877409497_3904457070468809006_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0&_nc_eui2=AeGj2QVsKI0dc_RCGjMsjXhSN7RZwXN2fgwA2Zkx0YdVZy1nRdLDeg7_cHjuM2McCPQpoWJGwAxL-Gpq06Na5dCRjxXfb2GjWlkD6pm2yr2WRw&oh=62feb00d6cc548eb611a8fef94e7316a&oe=5BDFD3F2) than on actually meeting their needs.
1.3.6.5.3.2.2.2.3. Con: The "shelters" are nearly [indistinguishable](https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/37019324_10210918906123518_5673545656489213952_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0&_nc_eui2=AeEsefCxzDCMLW_pVNiAx9_oLAjJl5U8oClSP5gWaFIEJ2AC_GaqXJWK_npSQfu-g6jYuGTZA-ys-3jl_cYrRZWJw36uHgSqCQcYSF-z6Fu2lw&oh=034dea57daf978012f27d04b9a86ecd9&oe=5BA0E44A) from jails or prisons.
1.3.6.5.3.2.2.3. Con: Governments can be forced to act by the weak, e.g. in lawsuits.
1.3.6.5.3.2.2.3.1. Con: This is only true if the government allows itself to be sued. Historically speaking, many governments have [not allowed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_immunity#Immunity_of_government_officials) that.
1.3.6.5.3.2.3. Pro: Without a government, the rich oligarchy would still be in power, but there would be fewer regulations to restrain their reach.
1.3.6.5.3.2.3.1. Pro: Rampant capitalism needs government restraint to prevent the formation of monopolies over entire business industries, e.g. [Time Warner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner) merging with other companies.
1.3.6.5.3.2.4. Pro: Anarchist societies can leave social minorities vulnerable to mob rule.
1.3.6.5.3.2.5. Pro: Anarchy leads to only one possibility. The strong ruling over the weak. Anarchy is the antithesis of ethics not its embodiment. Anarchy is the suggestion that individuals can be relied upon to act ethically. We know this to not be true. Some people will act ethically and some will not. Those that do not act ethically are governed by the their passions and desires. They can and will use unethical means to achieve these and dominate those that choose to act ethically.
1.3.6.5.3.3. Pro: Anarchy is not ethical when alternatives exist. Anarchy is a constant state of threat or conflict. Under anarchy, disputes erupt into violence and people align themselves with the powerful for protection \(think Tribal or Clan Warfare\).
1.3.6.5.3.4. Con: Right's are first of all not obeyed because of coercion \(like in a state system\) but because they are culturally accepted. In an anarchic culture all people are encouraged to take a stand on their part in society which in general is not wanted in state systems. Therefore working rules would be first of all upheld because of everyone's little action everyday.
1.3.6.5.3.5. Con: Any justification for violating the rights of the individual or group on the part of another individual or group claiming to represent the whole is invalid. Under an anarchic system, individuals may form groups for mutual defense against aggression. As long as these groups do not aggress upon others, they are not a form of government any more than a privately hired bodyguard or security firm.
1.3.6.5.3.5.1. Con: However, this does not exclude lawless individuals from exercising powerful aggression, defeating lawful, private defensive forces, and creating pseudo-governments \(such as mafias\). Under a government, these groups are easy to combat due to centralized law enforcement.
1.3.6.5.3.5.1.1. Con: There is no meaningful distinction between "pseudo-governments" and other governments which employ force and coercion against the general public. The argument is therefore "We must have a lawless government to prevent or fight any rival lawless governments we fear will be more oppressive than the lawless government we have created or chosen."
1.3.6.5.3.5.1.2. Pro: Because of the existence of aggressive, oppressive individuals and groups \(governments\), establishing and maintaining an anarchical society may be practically infeasible.
1.3.6.5.4. Pro: Without an agreed upon moral and ethical system in place that is administrated by an empowered authority, rights and justice boil down to violence, either on the part of a strong individual, or one who can ad-hoc rally others to their cause. If I had a large family of strong people, we would have no obligation to honor agreements or debts until a larger or stronger group came along. An organized government disposes of this needless and wasteful power play.
1.3.6.5.4.1. Con: An organized community can have in place a set of rules that are to be followed by everyone, and is universal within that community. These rules will have consequences, and repercussion for the failure to adhere to community guidelines, which would make one accountable per community to their own actions while they stay with that community.
1.3.6.5.5. Pro: Some people do not know what is best for them. Therefore, it is more ethical for them to be subject to those who know better than to have liberty to do as they please.
1.3.6.5.5.1. Con: If some people do not know what is best for them and that can justify a political system, this relativism could be followed to its logical conclusion that those advocating for a government might also not know what is best for them and that another political system \(such as anarchy\) is better justified.
1.3.6.5.5.2. Con: People should always have the right to reject interventions that affect them. Being subject to another person negates this right.
1.3.6.5.5.2.1. Pro: In many countries you may now [legally refuse](https://rightsinfo.org/medical-consent-human-rights/) a course of medical or psychiatric treatment that is deemed by professionals to be "what is best for you".
1.3.6.5.5.3. Con: What is best for an individual is highly subjective. There is nothing ethical about one individual deciding for another individual what is best for them.
1.3.6.5.5.3.1. Pro: Parents should not aggress against their children; rather, parents should serve only as guardians and providers for their children.
1.3.6.5.6. Pro: Anarchy does not protect the weak and vulnerable.
1.3.6.5.7. Con: Governments can [harm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity) citizens too.
1.3.6.5.7.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.
1.3.6.5.8. Con: An anarchist system isn't necessarily unstable. Political anarchism isn't a state of lawless anarchy.
1.3.6.5.8.1. Pro: Anarchy just means laws aren't [centralised](https://theconversation.com/what-is-anarchism-all-about-50373), horizontal structures can allow society to organise.
1.3.7. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.3.8. Pro: Governments use taxation to finance their actions and taxation is theft.
1.3.8.1. Pro: -> See discussion #7734: Taxation is theft
1.3.8.2. Con: Taxation is also a way to give those who are less fortunate a chance of a decent life. Hence, it is ethical.
1.3.8.3. Con: Taxation is voluntary because the taxpayers have the right to decline participation in taxed activities.
1.3.8.3.1. Con: [Indirect taxes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indirecttax.asp), like sales tax, are impossible to avoid.
1.3.8.3.1.1. Pro: Furthermore, governments often intentionally reach beyond acceptable limits. Charging a toll for the use of a road is acceptable if the government owns the road. However, a government taxing a private sale between two individuals is outside its rights.
1.3.8.3.2. Con: Many taxed activities are required to live. For example, earning income enough to eat or owning property for shelter are taxed. There is no alternative.
1.3.8.4. Con: Whether something is considered theft or not is determined by law. As taxation is lawful, it cannot be considered theft.
1.4. Pro: Anarchies are more effective at dealing with economic externalities than governments.
1.4.1. Pro: Anarchy is good for protecting the environment.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Governmental forces which can combat environmental destruction at the hands of profiteering institutions typically become ineffective at combatting these institutions.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: The nature of political campaigning, and its reliance on funds to put certain people in office over others, lays the ground for special interests to undermine environmental policy.
1.4.1.1.2. Pro: This is an example of how corruption is used to trade government violent authority in exchange for wealth under the table.
1.4.1.1.3. Pro: Institutions that exploit the environment can garner [phenomenal wealth](http://fortune.com/global500/), which allows them to dominate the discourse in the government.
1.4.1.1.4. Con: Environmental regulation in the Western World has proved effective in improving the natural environment and reducing previous damage.
1.4.1.1.4.1. Pro: British beaches were seriously polluted but have been [improved](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/25/95-of-british-beaches-clean-enough-to-swim-eu-tests-show) over time through governmental interventions.
1.4.1.1.4.2. Pro: The US Environmental protection agency has a history of [success](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-epa-first-40-years/) in restricting known environmental pollutants.
1.4.1.1.5. Con: Lobbying works both ways, so environmental groups can also pressure government to increase the effectiveness of environmental bodies.
1.4.1.1.5.1. Con: This leads to outcomes based on the relative strength of lobbying and not necessarily ethical ones.
1.4.1.2. Con: Under anarchism, the decision of whether to exploit or protect an environmental feature would be delegated to a body that wouldn't be required by regulations to consider the interests of all groups - yet environmental issues are most effectively tackled when they [are addressed collaboratively](https://phys.org/news/2017-08-kind-collaboration-key-environmental-problems.html) and when regulations and frameworks are put in place to stimulate collaboration.
1.4.1.3. Pro: Governments often have many other issues to deal with and therefore [fail to pay attention](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/09/world-governments-failing-earths-ecosystems-says-top-conservationist) to environmental protection or prioritize economic growth over it.
1.4.2. Con: Under anarchism it's easy to impose externalities on less powerful groups and individuals due to the absence of regulation.
1.4.2.1. Pro: If a company decided to place a polluting industry close to low-income homes, without a controlling third party like a government the individuals would have no recourse to protect themselves.
1.4.2.1.1. Con: The right to damages is not created by government. Private institutions can resolve conflicts more efficiently than government and act as a better recourse. [For instance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-capitalism#Law_and_order_and_the_use_of_violence), harmed parties can create a claim against the hypothetical company's insurance policy, compliance could then be enforced by powerful voluntary institutions that the harmed individual was a contributor to.
1.4.2.1.1.1. Con: Without a government, companies would not be required to have such an insurance policy.
1.4.2.2. Con: In anarchy, complaints regarding externalities could be handled in discussion, mediation, or civil court between the harmed parties and the group creating externalities. This leads to better resolutions than rules created by the government - an unrelated third party often having conflicts of interest.
1.4.2.2.1. Con: Without government there is no framework to require people to participate in the discussion and industries could simply overpower those who resist them.
1.4.3. Pro: The absence of a central authority to enforce a system of property rights gives activists more ability to take direct action in the form of obstruction and property destruction.
1.4.3.1. Con: Defense of private property rights would be more effective and the consequences more severe under anarchy, restricting the ability of activist through fear of consequences.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: The physical, economic, and political costs of individual implementing severe consequences for the violation of property are substantial when centralised government does not subsidise the use of force with their institutions. Over time ventures and institutions that rely on this would be superseded by ventures and institutions that don't experience resistance in the form of property destruction or obstruction.
1.4.3.2. Pro: Obstruction and property destruction tactics are used by the [Animal Liberation Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Liberation_Front) and [Earth First!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_First!).
1.5. Pro: Anarchy is flexible and is the best system to converge on rules desired by the people through a free market place of ideas.
1.5.1. Con: It is conceivable that people living in anarchy could set up governmental structures and thus eliminate anarchy. Freedom is the price of liberty.
1.5.1.1. Pro: Times of anarchy tend to be [short](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_anarchist_communities) and anarchies have so far mostly been surpassed by stable governments.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.
1.5.1.1.2. Con: In most cases, anarchist communities were simply shot down by the "stable governments".
1.5.2. Pro: Not being able to test many different rules before deciding on which one works best is equivalent to guessing the best rule.
1.5.3. Pro: For instance, under anarchy, the owner of a large business complex and shopping mall could choose to ban firearms from the premises or create strict rules for carry of firearms. Because all of this land is privately owned, a ban is lawful. Those who feel safer under gun control could freely do business here without infringing on anyone's right to self-defense. Likewise, those who prefer self-defense through firearms could choose to do business elsewhere. Businesses within have the same choice.
1.5.3.1. Pro: If the rules established by owners of such a complex are disliked by businesses, fewer businesses will locate there, causing the owners not to be very successful or capable of expanding. Likewise, if the rules are disliked by consumers buying from these businesses, the owners will not be able to attract businesses to rent there due to the rules turning away too many customers. Similarly, if rules meet a niche market, such a location would attract many businesses and customers.
1.5.3.2. Con: Under anarchy there can be no central registry of property. Thus no claim to property can be universally recognized.
While it is feasible that participants in society might agree to benignly recognize each other's claims to property, there is no guarantee these agreements will be honored under conflict and no universally recognized judiciary body to resolve conflicts of interest.
Thus, conflicts would likely be resolved through direct confrontation.
1.5.3.2.1. Con: Decentralized registries using blockchain technology exist today, making it possible to be universally recognized.
1.5.4. Con: There is no guarantee that ideas establish themselves based on the will of the community. People with power will still be able to enforce their ideas with coercion and force.
1.5.5. Con: While anarchy would provide the opportunity for a greater variety of rules, it cannot control which rules become more dominant than others.
1.5.5.1. Con: Rules become dominant as a function of voluntary acceptance. People are free to choose rules, adjudicators, and enforcement.
1.5.5.2. Pro: Rules might become dominant due to propaganda campaigns.
1.5.5.3. Pro: In a given area, only one set of rules/norms can be upheld. Without a centralized authority to determine which norms are to be followed, the result will be "might makes right," which is chaotic and unethical.
1.5.5.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.5.3.2.
1.5.5.4. Con: A locally established code of ethics which dictates how an individual acts and responds in a given situation helps to determine what sets of rules will be more dominant across communities.
1.5.5.5. Con: Cooperation from community to community can work to set up a more universal code of law.
1.6. Con: Anarchy is not about ethics or morality, it's about doing what you want, regardless of others or authority. An anarchic society would be like herding cats.
1.6.1. Con: The fact that anarchic society would be "like herding cats" doesn't say anything about the moral rightness of anarchy. To illustrate, the fact that cats are impossible to herd doesn't mean it's bad for them, maybe they just don't want to be herded and enjoy their lack of respect for authority.
1.6.2. Con: Anarchy has horizontal planning instead of vertical one. This allows a society to still thrive.
1.7. Con: Any system of society, that bears a high risk of being replaced by a highly unethical system \(e.g. rule of the strongest, totalitarianism\), has to be considered unethical. Any such forms of anarchism have to be rejected as unethical, even if life in an anarchic society were more ethical.
1.7.1. Con: One should not consider systems of society that are premised on voluntary interaction to be less stable than systems of society premised on threats of violent force. The world wars were not instigated by anarchic societies.
1.7.1.1. Con: Yet, an anarchic society has to face the potential of world wars. It is irrelevant, whether an anarchic society is capable of instigating world wars or not.
1.7.2. Con: Anarchic society is more ethical than alternatives because is not premised on violent force. We do not label individuals or groups as "unstable" simply because they are vulnerable to sociopathic violent attacks.
1.7.2.1. Con: In this context, "unstable" refers exactly to a vulnerability to attacks from inside or outside. As such, a society vulnerable to sociopathic violant attacks is considered to be unstable, if these attacks involve a high risk of overthrowing this society.
1.7.2.1.1. Con: No society is immune from violent sociopathic attacks, therefore per the claim above, all societies are unstable.
1.7.3. Pro: Similarily, the [democracy of the Weimar Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic#Institutional_problems) has to be considered less ethical than a ["streitbare Demokratie"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streitbare_Demokratie), because it has been overtaken by an authoritarian regime.
1.8. Con: There are necessary functions of government. If there was no government, entities or people would surely arise to fulfill those functions. They would become a de facto government, essentially eliminating the anarchist ideal.
1.8.1. Pro: One necessary function of government is to uphold justice. If justice is not upheld, society will tear itself apart. If justice is upheld, that implies an entity with the will and power to enforce the rules, i.e. a government. Thus, the anarchist model will either self-destruct or become obsolete.
1.8.1.1. Con: The justice system is run by human beings which are as susceptible to error or corruption as the other human being they are trying to rule over. Through history we see that some of the most unjust acts were sanctioned by governmental justice institutions.
1.8.2. Pro: One necessary function of government is national defense. Whatever entity controls the armed forces will have implied control of the population. If such an entity does not exist, the nation will probably not last long. If it does exist, it undermines the anarchist ideal.
1.8.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.
1.8.2.2. Con: Armed forces that "control the population" do so by force. Using force to control the population is not [national defense](https://thelawdictionary.org/national-defence/). If the population forms the country, then the population cannot be the enemy of the country and cannot be "controlled" in the name of national defense.
1.8.3. Con: The belief in that there should be a class with the right to control others by force, is as absurd as the belief in that human sacrifices to the gods need to be performed. This belief is the root of humanity's worst problems.
1.8.3.1. Con: Throughout human history, only systems with forcible state institutions have survived long-term and any attempts at anarchism have been short lived failures. There is substantial evidence that the state is necessary for the continued survival of a civilization, while there is no such evidence behind human sacrifices. This comparison is completely unfounded and absurd.
1.8.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.
1.8.4. Con: Any good or service is better provided in a voluntary manner by a free market competition, than imposed by a government monopoly.
1.8.5. Con: When an individual voluntarily associates with others who provide a good or service, it is not called a [Government](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/government) \(nor is it a "de facto government"\) because the person is not [governed](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/govern) by the providers.
1.8.6. Con: There are no "necessary functions of [government](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/government)". Legitimate government authority is delegated by individuals to legislators and enforced by agents of the State. Since all legitimate government authority is derived from individuals, the same authority could be provided by individuals, non-profits, corporations, or voluntary entities. Thusly, no legitimate functions of government require a government.
1.9. Pro: Humans are [naturally ethical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_savage) and anarchy provides them with the freedom to live ethically.
1.9.1. Pro: When basic rules of coexistence and respect are internalized and applied in all aspects of life, authority is not needed to impose them through coercion or otherwise.
1.9.1.1. Con: There are no basic rules of coexistence.
1.9.1.2. Con: In failed states \(and regions in functioning states isolated enough\) the power vacuum of the state is rapidly filled by warlords, gangs and drug cartels who provide the missing services such as education, medical care, police, etc., with varying levels of success. The underlying theme is that such strongmen tend to curtail liberties instead of allowing anarchistic freedom.
1.9.1.3. Con: An example of anarchistic freedom is the Internet \(although shrinking proportions of it\). Unregulated forums and web communities do not evolve into anarchistic utopias of ethical behavior, but instead into abusive commentary, witch hunting, doxing, spam, malware and other negative behaviors. Nearly all such unregulated sites turn to more and more moderators \(community or paid\) over time to have the signal to noise ratio not approach zero.
1.9.2. Con: Judging by contemporary events, people are not ready for this system and require education before it can work.
1.9.2.1. Pro: Anarchy is the only absolutely ethical system of society, although this does not mean that the existence of government is always bad; being necessary in intermediary stages of social development.
1.9.2.2. Con: The idea that people should be ready for it leads to the idea that a leader is necessary and people must be controlled, at least for now. But in a democracy, for example, it is people who choose their leader. Someone who is provided with the right to choose a leader can be ready to coexist harmonically in a social environment.
1.9.3. Con: Other sociologists \(e.g.: [Thomas Hobbes](https://www.iep.utm.edu/hobmoral/)\) describe the human in their natural state to be [aggressive and warlike people](https://www.iep.utm.edu/hobmoral/). The only reason they deviate from that path is to save energy by forcing themselves under a strong leader. \(source: Thomas Hobbes and [Georg Simmel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Simmel)\)
1.9.3.1. Pro: Humans have a long and prominent history of intra-species violence.
1.9.4. Con: Natural ethics is a contradiction.
1.9.4.1. Pro: Ethics doesn't follow from the laws of nature. It is a construct of sentient actors \(humans\), who decide what is ethical and what is not.
1.9.4.1.1. Pro: Being ethical because we decide what is ethical is a logical loop.
1.9.4.2. Con: -> See discussion #2649: Morality is objective.
1.9.5. Con: For the last few millenia human morals evolved in different legal systems. Claiming that human morals are natural and not a product of thousands of years of operation within these systems is unsupported.
1.10. Con: Anarchy is the absence of a higher authority. In the absence of an external authority, a state cannot be sure that today's friend will not be tomorrow's enemy. The same concept could be applied at the individual level.
1.11. Con: Anarchism is an unproven political system, with very few working examples. We do not know whether it would prove viable in practice.
1.11.1. Con: It is not unproven, thousands of people live like this their entire life.
1.11.1.1. Pro: [Zomia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zomia_\(region\)) is a geographical region stretching from the Vietnamese highlands and Tibetan plateau to Afghanistan. Zomia is seen by some political scientists, such as Yale political scientist [James Scott](https://libcom.org/library/art-not-being-governed-anarchist-history-upland-southeast-asia), as a rejection of the modern-day state and an example of [an anarchist society](https://anarchyinaction.org/index.php?title=Zomia) in action.
1.11.1.2. Pro: [Twin Oaks Community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Oaks_Community,_Virginia) is an intentional community of about one hundred people in Virginia.  The community engages in activities such as gardening and making hammocks and pools the resources and money earned. All the bikes, automobiles, computers, and recreational facilities thus purchased are owned by the community, and all items are available for general use.
1.11.1.3. Pro: [Freetown Christiania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freetown_Christiania) is a self-proclaimed autonomous anarchist district of about 850 to 1,000 residents in Copenhagen. The people in Christiania have developed their own set of rules, independent of the Danish government.
1.11.1.4. Con: Thousands of people in a world of billions does not make anything proven.
1.11.1.4.1. Con: Statistically speaking, relative sample size is an irrelevant factor. Sound causality, correct statistical model and absolute sample size are needed for generalized statements.
1.11.2. Con: Just because something is unproven doesn't mean it isn't a better system. New systems are unproven by definition.
1.11.2.1. Pro: Ending slavery was also an unproven political system at some point, with very few working examples. People did not know whether it would prove viable in practice.
1.11.2.1.1. Con: Ending slavery in the United States wasn't a complete overhaul of the governmental and political system. Ending slavery happened within the existing political system, so isn't a close analogy to replacing existing governments with anarchism.
1.11.2.1.2. Con: The process of abolishing slavery worldwide and in the US has been a [progressive process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_abolition_of_slavery_and_serfdom). It didn't go from slavery everywhere in the US to none after[The Emancipation Proclamation](https://www.history.com/topics/american-civil-war/emancipation-proclamation) or the [13th Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution), there were already areas with abolition.
1.11.2.2. Pro: Just because a new and unproven system claims to be better does not mean it deserves an opportunity to prove itself.
1.11.3. Con: Most human relationships are voluntary nowadays, and all stand as examples of how relationships would exist within anarchy. The opposite is what breaks the norm - it's usually called "crime", unless it's committed by the state.
1.11.3.1. Con: A relationship with employers is hardly voluntary. Without an option to opt out of wage labour, and capitalism generally, there isn't a choice to be made. Either you exploit labour or you are labour.
1.11.4. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.
1.11.5. Pro: The ethical status of an anarchist system of society depends on the outcomes produced by that system for the people living within it. Since we do not know what those outcomes would be, we don't know whether anarchy would be an ethical system.
1.11.6. Pro: Most states do not last long in a [state of Anarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_anarchist_communities) and those that do can hardly be held up as [ethical utopias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchy#Examples_of_state-collapse_anarchy). They actually tend to be failed states.
1.11.7. Con: There is a good modern example of an Anarchist society: parts of [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Revolution_of_1936) after the 1936 revolution.
1.11.7.1. Pro: George Orwell spoke of this society in [positive terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Revolution_of_1936#Orwell's_account): "There was much in this that I did not understand, in some ways I did not even like it, but I recognized it immediately as a state of affairs worth fighting for."
1.12. Con: -> See 1.3.6.5.
