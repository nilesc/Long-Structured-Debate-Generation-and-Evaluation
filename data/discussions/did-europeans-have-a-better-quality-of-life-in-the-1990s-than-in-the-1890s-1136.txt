Discussion Title: Did Europeans Have a Better Quality of Life in the 1990s than in the 1890s?

1. Europeans, defined as citizens of what today constitutes the European Union \(EU\), had a better quality of life in the 1990s, than in the 1890s.
1.1. Pro: Legal and political developments brought significant improvements of Europeans' quality of life.
1.1.1. Pro: Democratization had improved the quality of life because of citizens' right to vote and the ability to choose their leaders.
1.1.1.1. Con: Being a passive subject is more comfortable than being an active citizen.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: In democracies citizens have to deal with more tasks: informing and lots of reading, following the public debates, going to the election etc..
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: If a person does not want to vote then she/he can simply not vote.
1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Subjects do not have to feel responsible for wrong or "bad" policies, because they did not vote for the government and can not change it anyway.
1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.1.1.3. Pro: A strong "all knowing" leader or party is quite a comfort, because people do not have to think for themselves.
1.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: The philosopher Plato drew a conception of the [best state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_\(Plato\)) in which he speaks for a regime of the best and most wise citizens \("philosopher kings"\), which finally results in a benefit for the whole society.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Plato had no idea about modernity and is thus not applicable anymore. He just did not integrate modern technology in his equation.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: The technological advancements made in modern times allowed for even better performance judgement. That would integrate with ease into Plato´s concepts.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: The affluence of information reduces certainty that the information retrieved is correct.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: It is impossible to read all information, and thus humans are likely to make decisions based on insufficient information.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.2. Con: Conflicting information makes judgement more difficult.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Within the frameset of Plato´s theory, conflicting information would not be an issue, because those in charge would know that through their education and their abilities to see the idea of good, truth becomes correctness \(see comments\) and the information where one makes decisions on is correct.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2. Pro: Due to technological and societal advancements on all scales of life, life itself became "faster" and therefore more complicated.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.1. Con: Adapting to new times, technologies and changes are a key part of human evolution, thus having such criteria as "fast" or complicated seems to be nothing more than just a selection process of who will be able to succeed in the future and who will not.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.2. Con: The time-space compression of the late 19th century was comparable in scale to the one experienced in the 20th century.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.2.1. Con: The [world shrank](http://www.univpgri-palembang.ac.id/perpus-fkip/Perpustakaan/East%20Phylosopy/Economic%20Geography/Time-Space%20Compression.pdf) faster between 1930 and 1990 than ever before. Thus, there was more time-space compression in the 1990s.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.2.2. Con: In the 20th century, compression benefits of technology could not only be enjoyed by the elites and thus a wider section of society gained access to it.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.2.3. Pro: Time-space compression occurs gradual and in slow steps. These were as evident in the 19th century as in the 20th century.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.2.3.1. Pro: [Steamboats](http://www.univpgri-palembang.ac.id/perpus-fkip/Perpustakaan/East%20Phylosopy/Economic%20Geography/Time-Space%20Compression.pdf) reduced the time from Montreal to Kingston on average for a few minutes per year. Equally, between 1940 and 1990 the [flight time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_flight) from New York to London reduced by 7 minutes per year.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.2.4. Pro: Colonialism, the [most explicit and enduring symbol](http://www.univpgri-palembang.ac.id/perpus-fkip/Perpustakaan/East%20Phylosopy/Economic%20Geography/Time-Space%20Compression.pdf) of time-space compression, was at its peak in the 19th century.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.2.4.1. Pro: Colonialism brought the world together for the first time. The airplane just made it faster.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.2.5. Pro: The [French railroad system](http://www.univpgri-palembang.ac.id/perpus-fkip/Perpustakaan/East%20Phylosopy/Economic%20Geography/Time-Space%20Compression.pdf) was integrating all lives into a national economy by the 1890s already. The acceleration into a European economy was slower in the 20th century.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.2.6. Pro: The [speed of steamships](http://www.univpgri-palembang.ac.id/perpus-fkip/Perpustakaan/East%20Phylosopy/Economic%20Geography/Time-Space%20Compression.pdf) grew fourfold in the 19th century while it only doubled in the 20th century.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.2.7. Pro: [Different eras](http://www.univpgri-palembang.ac.id/perpus-fkip/Perpustakaan/East%20Phylosopy/Economic%20Geography/Time-Space%20Compression.pdf) of time space compression are thought to be roughly comparable.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.2.8. Pro: [Karl Marx](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch10.htm) already spoke of an ‘annihilation of space by time’ to describe the situation in the19th century.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.3. Pro: Between 1890 and 1990 the suicide rate increased significantly in Europe because of modernization.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.3.1. Con: Suicide became an option for many who were deterred from it during the 19th century because of the [social stigma and shame](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=Zi-xoFAPnPMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Comprehensive+Textbook+of+Suicidology&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwju5qaU1ZLMAhWF5qYKHXElDFUQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&q=Comprehensive%20Textbook%20of%20Suicidology&f=false) it brought on their own legacy as well as on their families.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.3.1.1. Con: After committing suicide the family left behind will suffer predominantly through the loss and only less so through social stigma.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.3.1.2. Con: After committing suicide the person does not need to care about family left behind.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.3.2. Pro: With increasing urbanization the suicide rate in Finland surged from 5 per 100.000 in [1890](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1389426) to 30 per 100.000 in [1990](http://www.who.int/mental_health/media/finl.pdf).
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.3.3. Pro: In [Ireland](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/4/Mental_Health_Services/NOSP/Research/suicideoireachtas.pdf), suicide rates grew seven times between 1890 and 1990.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.3.4. Con: In already industrialized societies the suicide rate was roughly the same in 1890 as it was in 1990.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.3.4.1. Pro: In [England and Wales](http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/6/1464.long) the suicide rate of 1990 was lower than that of 1890.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.3.4.2. Pro: The [big cities](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=Zi-xoFAPnPMC&pg=PA128&lpg=PA128&dq=suicide+rate+1900&source=bl&ots=DDE5W4gbkv&sig=itYeiU1X6rT5asqKCZum4bbubwY&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjc4J2jmu7KAhWCEpQKHaG3CXkQ6AEIXTAH#v=onepage&q&f=false) of the 19th century alientated people and drove them into self-killings.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.3.4.2.1. Pro: Modernity in cities precluded its advent at the countryside.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.3.4.3. Pro: The [suicide levels in France](http://www.who.int/mental_health/media/fran.pdf) 1890 are roughly comparabe to those 1990.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.3.5. Pro: In the process of modernization in [England](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=mvuK7dzSVrkC&pg=PR9&lpg=PR9&dq=suicide+rate+1900&source=bl&ots=7ci6kyW4Vt&sig=diyCIIJiFLUloKPoyoVMA2SUp60&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjqvKKumu7KAhWJVZQKHVqjBqo4ChDoAQgZMAA#v=onepage&q&f=false) between 1820 and 1890 suicide rates surged but once the country modernized suicide rates leveled. All countries follow this pattern.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.3.5.1. Pro: Suicide rates in [Poland](http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-12-644) increased dramatically since the 1970s with a process of societal modernization.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.3.5.2. Pro: The link between modernization and suicide rate was established by [Emilé Durkheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_\(book\)) in 1893.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.3.5.3. Pro: Suicide rates rose in tandem with modernization in [Bohemia](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=6UQ795kJdkQC&pg=PA42&lpg=PA42&dq=selbstmordrate+1900&source=bl&ots=GXRVCRBJ1o&sig=SO7Cr7905eAqObRkfQQPU8QXPTM&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi90KnWme7KAhXJmJQKHTA3BOgQ6AEIOTAG#v=onepage&q=selbstmordrate%201900&f=false) in the 19th century.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.4. Con: Stress-related phenomena such as burnout were [already visible in 1890](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=jJ8-SCS0NhEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Burnout+for+Experts&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Burnout%20for%20Experts&f=false), although under different names and with less clinical attention and social acceptance.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.5. Pro: Large scale real-time communication makes life faster.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.6. Pro: Technology is [taking away from](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9406E5D8163AF932A35756C0A9679D8B63&pagewanted=all) time spent in person with family and friends.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.6.1. Con: Technology gives us more opportunities to contact family and friends, especially in long distance situations
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.7. Pro: In the 1990s life was way more hectic than back in the 1890s.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.7.1. Con: Before the widespread use of PCs and cellphones the 1990s were still relatively relaxed and focused on the immediate social sphere.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.7.1.1. Pro: In times of landlines phoning time was technically limited.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.7.1.2. Pro: People were interacting more on a personal basis before the advent of internet chats.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.7.2. Con: There were more social obligations for a bourgeois family in the 1890s than in the 1990s. This made daily life more hectic.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.7.3. Pro: In general in the 1990s there was less "quiet" time for most people, due to the common use of mass media and telephones.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.7.3.1. Con: Instead of telephones, newspaper vendors would scream out the latest news. The advent of delivery services made it much more quiet.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.7.3.2. Pro: There being less private time, people most probably had less privacy as well.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.7.4. Pro: Especially in big cities and metropolitan regions everything was noisy and colorful and always in motion.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.7.4.1. Con: Big cities in the 1890s were more noisy and colorful than the cities of 1990s because of increasing regulation.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.7.4.1.1. Pro: Decibel limits had been introduced across Europe by the 1990s. These limit for example the sound emmission of factories in cities.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.7.4.2. Con: Urban density peaked globally around 1890; ever since urban density [has been in decline](http://www.lincolninst.edu/pubs/1834_The-Persistent-Decline-in-Urban-Densities) and made cities less crowded by 1990.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.7.4.2.1. Pro: There were more pedestrians in the city of 1890 and so it was more hectic to go somewhere.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.8. Con: People in 1990 were better adapted to a fast lifestyle than people in 1890.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.8.1. Pro: Because [technological changes](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2016-02-15/innovation-over) in the 19th century were bigger than in the 20th century, people in the 1990s found it easier to adapt.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.8.2. Pro: People in the 1990s felt confident that their [life will change](http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb48/eb48_en.pdf) in the 21st century.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.8.3. Con: By 1890, people in early industrialized areas of Europe got already used to the full benefits of 19th century technology.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.8.3.1. Pro: London's population growth as well as [infrastructure projects and landmarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_London#19th_century) were already completed by the 1890s.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.8.3.2. Pro: [World fairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Exhibition) had become popular sights since 1851 allowing citizens to enjoy and experience innovations of technology.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.8.3.2.1. Con: World fairs were confined to metropolis and did not lead to an exposure of the wider public that lived in rural areas or other cities.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.8.3.3. Pro: The citizens of Paris were in the middle of the [Belle Époque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_in_the_Belle_%C3%89poque) which marked the heighday of Paris as innovative capital.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.8.3.4. Pro: The perils of modern warfare were already well known to many Europeans.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.8.3.4.1. Con: It was just the [First World War](http://www.wsj.com/articles/world-war-i-the-war-that-changed-everything-1403300393) that transformed the way society saw war.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.8.3.4.2. Pro: The citizens of Paris were already used to the devastation of modern warfare as experienced in the times of the [Paris Commune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Commune) 1971.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.8.3.4.3. Pro: In the [Crimean War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_War) 1853 modern technology was used. 500.000 French and British soldiers were learning how industrialization works.
1.1.1.1.3.1.2. Con: Plato has not had access to other research that was added in the 2000 years inbetween. Thus his judgement about modernity is at best mediocre.
1.1.1.1.3.1.2.1. Con: Plato´s idea of the perfect state relies very strong on performance in given subjects as main quality, a principle which is still pretty strong mapped in modern concepts like capitalism and market societies.
1.1.1.1.4. Pro: Many philosophical approaches come to the conclusion that a non active life is the better option.
1.1.1.1.4.1. Pro: Plato, although writing a theory about how to organize a state, preferred a non active life, being disenchanted with politics.
1.1.1.1.4.2. Pro: "Vita contemplativa" or "bios theoretikos" are concepts which aim at a life without being exposed to active participation within political processes.
1.1.1.1.5. Con: States with passive citizens have the most death camps to punish those whose passiveness deviates.
1.1.1.1.5.1. Pro: [North Korea](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2565240/Voices-damned-These-horrifying-stories-concentration-camp-victims-reveal-chilling-clarity-week-North-Korea-likened-Nazi-Germany.html) has the most passive citizenry and runs several death camps.
1.1.1.2. Con: Many Europeans did not vote in the 1990s. Apparently the right to vote has not improved their life significantly enough.
1.1.1.3. Pro: The right to vote manifests a link with society and therefore creates a feeling of bonds that give emotional stability.
1.1.1.4. Pro: Changes in policy do not require violence and thus allow for more flexible policy responses to social problems.
1.1.1.4.1. Pro: Regime changes in democracies are taken at the ballot box in peace, while changes in dictatorships typically lynch the incumbent power holder.
1.1.1.5. Con: Non-democracies are less bound by the citizens and can thus better command resources for the aim to improve the quality of life.
1.1.1.5.1. Pro: The biggest economic [miracles](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=uiFH5dh12p0C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=snippet&q=rapidly%20growing%20&f=false) have occurred under non-democratic regimes.
1.1.1.5.1.1. Con: After WWII Germany experienced an economic miracle \("[Miracle on the Rhine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirtschaftswunder)"\) and was a democracy.
1.1.1.5.1.2. Con: Japan grew very much after it embraced democracy after [WWII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_economic_miracle).
1.1.1.5.2. Pro: With the rule of law, administration, management and other non military-related structures which demand a "chain of command" became less efficient.
1.1.1.5.2.1. Pro: A hire and fire policy is easier to implement without rule of law.
1.1.1.5.2.1.1. Con: In the [UK](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/26/hire-and-fire-destroyed-uk-jobs) there is a strong rule of law but it is easy to hire and fire.
1.1.1.5.2.2. Pro: Administrations, especially the people working there, have way too much "wiggle room" nowadays instead of following orders given to them.
1.1.1.5.2.2.1. Con: In settings where rule of law is absent administrators have even more 'wiggle room' because the systems are prone to corruption.
1.1.1.5.2.2.2. Pro: In almost every welfare service and parts of special administrations \(for example, everything you want to build on your ground which will be permanent, thus "Bauamt"\), the people deciding on applications have huge individual "wiggle room" whether to grant certain services or not, allow permissions or not or other things.
1.1.1.5.2.2.2.1. Con: The corruption of the administration in authoritarian regimes is much higher. This indicated that they, in practice, have more room for individual decision-making.
1.1.1.5.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: [North Korea](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2859721/North-Korea-world-s-corrupt-country-Eye-opening-interactive-map-ranks-country-s-transparency-Denmark-topping-list.html) is the world's most corrupt and most authoritarian state.
1.1.1.5.2.3. Pro: Physical punishment is forbidden.
1.1.1.5.2.3.1. Con: There is physical punishment where there is rule of law, e.g. it was used in the [UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_corporal_punishment#United_Kingdom) in the 1960s.
1.1.1.5.2.4. Pro: Data preservation is a highly discussed topic, instead of just making it for the sake of security.
1.1.1.5.2.4.1. Con: The means of storage are only under discussion for their impact on data protection.
1.1.1.5.2.5. Pro: Rule of law, as it is understood in Europe \(on paper\), grants rights towards the citizens and those \(the citizens\) are misconceived as capable of using them to the benefit of the state.
1.1.1.5.2.6. Con: Rule of law guarantuees continuity of procedure even if the head of the administration is exchanged.
1.1.1.5.2.7. Con: Rule of law allows for legal protection of agency misconduct.
1.1.1.5.2.8. Con: A chain of command can be legally prescribed.
1.1.1.5.2.8.1. Pro: A chain of command is proscribed in situations where only doctors can diagnose death and not the ambulance drivers themselves.
1.1.1.5.2.9. Con: Individual agencies are better performing if they act in concert with other agencies. A legally prescribed way of cooperation thus enhances effectiveness.
1.1.1.5.2.9.1. Con: Too much coordination can cause red tape.
1.1.1.5.3. Con: Democracies have higher [technology-induced](http://www.sv.uio.no/esop/english/research/news-and-events/events/2009/DemocTechnolCHK.pdf) economic growth than dictatorships.
1.1.1.5.3.1. Pro: Dictators have to [trade off](http://www.sv.uio.no/esop/english/research/news-and-events/events/2009/DemocTechnolCHK.pdf) increased growth against increased possibility of being thrown out of office.
1.1.1.5.4. Con: Because support for a dictator is [decreasing](http://petros.sekeris.org/dictator) with the degree of equality in the economy  they have to seek re-distributional policies.
1.1.1.5.4.1. Pro: The median voter’s preferred policy can yield inefficiently low [growth rates](http://petros.sekeris.org/dictator) because of over-redistributive policy.
1.1.1.5.4.2. Con: Decreasing support of the elites will lead to regime instability and thus, the dictator has an incentive to favor the elite over the general population.
1.1.1.5.4.2.1. Pro: In [South Korea](https://books.google.co.kr/books/about/Korea_s_Place_in_the_Sun_A_Modern_Histor.html?id=yKN_q-TqYYgC&redir_esc=y) the military leadership nurtured the business elite while keeping the average population out of the economic miracle.
1.1.1.5.5. Pro: Non-democracies can easier extract ressources from society.
1.1.1.5.5.1. Pro: Non-democracies tend to have higher [tax levels](http://www.lse.ac.uk/internationalDevelopment/pdf/WP/WP89.pdf).
1.1.1.5.5.1.1. Con: Democracies cannot urge collective action and have to [compensate](http://www.lse.ac.uk/internationalDevelopment/pdf/WP/WP89.pdf) by increasing taxes to provide public goods.
1.1.1.5.5.1.1.1. Con: Democracies can make use of ideologies, such as nationalism, to induce collective actions.
1.1.1.5.5.1.1.2. Pro: Non-democracies do not need to [provide](http://www.lse.ac.uk/internationalDevelopment/pdf/WP/WP89.pdf) as many public goods as democracies.
1.1.1.5.5.2. Pro: Non-democracies can recruit soldiers easier than democracies.
1.1.1.5.5.3. Pro: Non-democracies can formulate an ideology that makes the population accept more suffering.
1.1.1.5.5.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.5.5.1.1.1.
1.1.1.5.5.3.2. Pro: Governments can influence [historical](http://samples.sainsburysebooks.co.uk/9781135083328_sample_492523.pdf) narratives to support government policy.
1.1.1.5.5.3.2.1. Pro: History schoolbooks can be written to support government policy.
1.1.1.5.5.3.2.2. Pro: Memorials and museums further a certain narrative of the past. This narrative influences support for government policy.
1.1.1.5.5.3.2.3. Pro: Through installing rituals and anniversaries the state becomes linked to certain political objectives. Choosing these rituals and anniversaries equals the power of government policies.
1.1.1.5.5.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.5.5.1.1.2.
1.1.1.5.5.4. Con: Democracies [mobilize](http://www.yale.edu/polisci/rosenbluth/Papers/warlike%20democracies%20feb.pdf) domestic ressources to a greater extent than non-democracies.
1.1.1.5.5.4.1. Con: The rallying effects of democratization are stronger in the beginning of a democracy than in established democracies because ideological motivations vanish over time.
1.1.1.5.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.5.5.1.1.2.
1.1.1.5.7. Pro: In democracies, individual interests are better positioned to cause [suboptimal policies](http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.polisci.1.1.289?journalCode=polisci).
1.1.1.5.7.1. Con: Policies that are the result of deliberate discussion take account of societies interests and thus are optimal to fulfill society's needs.
1.1.1.5.7.2. Pro: When threatened by war long decision-making procedures are costly.
1.1.1.5.8. Pro: Strong governments can override domestic concerns by force and steer the economy towards growth.
1.1.1.5.8.1. Pro: Keeping the value of ones currency artificially low, gives exporting branches huge chances to grow.

1.1.2.1.1.2.6. Pro: Free trade among European countries created [trade diversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_diversion) and therewith strengthened the market position of European suppliers.
1.1.2.1.1.3. Pro: The harmonization of European standards has led to increased economic living conditions across Europe.
1.1.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: Standardization facilitates consumption because consumers in different countries can easier use a product and therewith enlarge the market.
1.1.2.1.1.3.2. Pro: Standardization allows for focused R&D expenditures.
1.1.2.1.1.3.3. Pro: European standardization sets the global standard which benefited European companies.
1.1.2.1.1.4. Pro: Technology transfer among European countries helped developing parts of Europe to build a strong economy.
1.1.2.1.1.5. Pro: Through integration labor and capital mobility was increased which helped the economy to grow.
1.1.2.1.1.6. Pro: The [terms of trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_trade) for small countries improved significantly with the creation of a common customs union.
1.1.2.1.1.7. Pro: Integration helped the EC to establish itself as a more influential bargaining power in international negotiations and therewith was able to create more preferential deals.
1.1.2.1.1.8. Pro: Exchange rate mechanisms allowed for higher stability of European markets and therewith improved economic circumstances for producers and consumers alike.
1.1.2.1.1.9. Pro: Because of greater resources sizeable subsidy and innovative programs could be supported.
1.1.2.1.1.9.1. Pro: Airbus was established as a competitor to Boeing on a European wide scheme unthinkable to be feasible by a single state alone.
1.1.2.1.1.10. Pro: The economic integration within the EU caused, at least temporary, [positive effects](http://epub.wu.ac.at/170/1/document.pdf) on the member states' economies.
1.1.2.1.2. Con: The creation of the EU reduced the importance of the nation state which is important for many Europeans.
1.1.2.1.2.1. Con: The idea of the nation is separating people and supporting prejudices and therefore should be overcome.
1.1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: A feeling of nationhood redirects citizens attention and feelings to a certain group while discounting those in other groups.
1.1.2.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Domestic news were more important than news of equal importance abroad in the 1990s.
1.1.2.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Routines embedded in the [organizational structure](http://dare.uva.nl/document/2/48936) of news agencies make them more likely to report on domestic news because they can easily relate and evaluate domestic events.
1.1.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Members of national news agencies are most likely members of that nation and not more diversified.
1.1.2.1.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: [External constraints](http://dare.uva.nl/document/2/48936), such as financial control or readership, demand domestic news to stay informed about ongoing political processes.
1.1.2.1.2.1.1.1.3. Pro: Journalists become only more sensitive to European wide issues if they were socialized in Brussels and feel the ['beat'](http://dare.uva.nl/document/2/48936).
1.1.2.1.2.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: Once socialized British journalists usually [complain](http://ejc.sagepub.com/content/10/3/321.short) about the biased coverage about the EU in the UK.
1.1.2.1.2.1.1.1.4. Pro: The large [audience](http://dare.uva.nl/document/2/48937) typically turns to national instead of international news for information about the state of politics and the economy.
1.1.2.1.2.1.1.1.5. Con: US news played a huge part in European media.
1.1.2.1.2.1.1.1.5.1. Con: The US plays such a big part in European media as it is such an important partner \(economic, political, military...\) for Europe; thus it was considered of domestic importance.
1.1.2.1.2.1.1.1.5.2. Pro: For example the US presidential elections were mentioned almost daily in TV, newspapers or online.
1.1.2.1.2.1.1.1.5.2.1. Pro: The German magazine "Der Spiegel" reported several times about the US election back in the 1990s. \(see [here](http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-8947088.html) and [here](http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-8939615.html)\)
1.1.2.1.2.1.1.1.6. Pro: Domestic news have a higher direct effect on domestic citizens and are therefore more important.
1.1.2.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Attention is put on the group differences perceived by the majority instead of focusing on problems.
1.1.2.1.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: Religion, skin color or class are emphasized to explain problems rather than the social dynamics themselves.
1.1.2.1.2.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Generalizations about 'the Islam' or the 'Colored' are seen as the source of crime, evil or economic downturn and not the structural factors that lead to it.
1.1.2.1.2.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Easy scapegoats are more convenient than changes to society at large.
1.1.2.1.2.1.1.3. Con: An emerging European identity likewise redirects attention to other Europeans. The process and discrimination of others will remain.
1.1.2.1.2.1.2. Con: Competition \(and with that a certain "natural" separation already assuming to exist\) between nations drove development on multiple levels significantly forward.
1.1.2.1.2.1.2.1. Con: In a competitive environment it is very difficult to tackle externalities while it is fairly easy to deal with them under cooperation.
1.1.2.1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: Instruments to deal with environmental problems are more likely to be implemented and adhered to if a mood of cooperation prevails.
1.1.2.1.2.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: The [Maastricht Treaty](http://europa.eu/eu-law/decision-making/treaties/pdf/treaty_on_european_union/treaty_on_european_union_en.pdf) called for 'economic streamlining' and the inclusion of the environment in issues such as fisheries or agriculture. Without such a streamlining it would be more difficult to achieve policy objectives.
1.1.2.1.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: Transportation problems are easier tackled within integration because it allows for wider infrastructure projects and raises safety standards across a region.
1.1.2.1.2.1.2.2. Pro: Necessity is the mother of all innovation.
1.1.2.1.2.1.2.3. Pro: Technological advancements were made.
1.1.2.1.2.1.2.3.1. Pro: The so called [Space Race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race) between the USA and the Soviet Union pushed space flight and astronautics significantly.
1.1.2.1.2.1.2.4. Pro: Human rights were implemented stronger during the progress of time.
1.1.2.1.2.1.2.4.1. Con: China is successful in economic terms despite being ignorant of human rights.
1.1.2.1.2.1.2.5. Pro: Economic standards rose during the time.
1.1.2.1.2.1.2.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.
1.1.2.1.2.1.2.6. Con: The "competition" and with it the advancement were in huge amounts driven by war, thus coming at a way too high cost.
1.1.2.1.2.1.3. Pro: Nation building results in war and should be overcome.
1.1.2.1.2.1.3.1. Pro: Before the two great wars of the last century there was kind of a national spirit in Europe. So actively weakening this dangerous thoughts is preferable.
1.1.2.1.2.1.3.2. Con: Not all forms of nationalism need war as a source of creation.
1.1.2.1.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: [Civic nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_nationalism) is achieved more through civil war than through war, as the examples of US and France show.
1.1.2.1.2.1.3.2.1.1. Con: A civil war is still a [war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War#Types).
1.1.2.1.2.1.3.2.2. Pro: [Left-wing nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_nationalism), as in Cuba or India, is not aggressive towards other nations.
1.1.2.1.2.1.3.3. Con: There were wars before there were nations.
1.1.2.1.2.1.4. Con: Nation building was positive to the people because its benefits outweigh the cost.
1.1.2.1.2.1.4.1. Pro: Nation building allowed for the creation of soldiers and workers that can be directed by a central authority and therefore are enhancing effectiveness of a society on a delineated territory.
1.1.2.1.2.1.4.2. Pro: Nation building guaranteed independence from foreign occupation.
1.1.2.1.2.1.4.3. Pro: Nations have the capacity to pacify its people and therefore enhance stability.
1.1.2.1.2.2. Con: In the 1990s most Europeans thought [rarely](http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb35/eb35_en.pdf) about their European identity. It is therefore unlikely that a European identity had a major effect on abolishing national identities.
1.1.2.1.2.3. Con: Nationalist ideas are on the rise despite the creation of the EU.
1.1.2.1.2.3.1. Pro: Nationalist parties \(such as Front National or other right wing parties\) were on the rise since the creation of the EU.
1.1.2.1.2.4. Pro: European citizenship was firmly established next to national citizenship. This leads to a [transnationalisation](http://www.suhrkamp.de/buecher/on_europe_s_constitution-juergen_habermas_6214.html?d_view=english) of democracy that works against the role of individual states.
1.1.2.1.2.4.1. Pro: European citizenship was established in 1992 by the [Maastricht Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_of_the_European_Union).
1.1.2.1.2.5. Pro: Europeans can use supranational working methods to change the nation states, e.g. through European Parliament elections, the European Citizen Initiative or the European Court of Justice.
1.1.2.1.2.6. Pro: The EU has taken tremendous responsibility away from the state, e.g. negotiations at the WTO or custom management.
1.1.2.1.2.6.1. Pro: The EU Commission represents all member states with one voice in the WTO. Other than in the UN it is not possible for individual members to put forward an independent opinion. Instead, the Commission gets its guidelines from the '[Article 133](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commissioner_for_Trade#WTO)' Committee of the Council of the EU.
1.1.2.1.2.7. Pro: It is a declared political goal of the EU to foster an European identity for its citizens. For example the [Europeana](http://www.academia.edu/1465794/Europeana_Building_a_European_Identity) project was founded with that in mind.
1.1.2.1.2.7.1. Pro: An overall European identity leads to supersession of national identities.
1.1.2.1.3. Con: The EU abolished established frameworks of decision making in favor of an ineffective and costly procedure.
1.1.2.1.3.1. Pro: National parliaments have to give up certain aspects of their authorities to an European Level.
1.1.2.1.3.2. Pro: The working arrangements of EU institutions are not very good when compared to national ones because of the institutional set-up.
1.1.2.1.3.3. Pro: It is an additional level of decision making that makes effective implementation more difficult.
1.1.2.1.3.4. Con: The EU has a relatively good track record of [efficiency](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1350176042000164280?journalCode=rjpp20) given it operates at lower costs but has a comparable workload of a government.
1.1.2.1.4. Con: The EU actively destroys the national identities of Europe, by trying to force an "one size fits all" European identity over everybody.
1.1.2.1.4.1. Con: The same can be said about national states. They bring an "one size fits all" national identity for smaller societal groups, for example from different provinces or towns.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1. Con: Most national states have an unifying frame-set under which the identification with the national state is possible. Be it cultural \(language, history, culture, heritage, etc.\) or solely based on constitutions which are the only sources of identification needed and therefore powerful enough to perpetrate everyday life. None of this applies to the EU.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.1. Con: There are many examples of regions that do not identify themselves with the Nation State at all.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: Many people in South Tyrol do not want to be Italian.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: In 1992 South Tyrol gained [autonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Tyrol#Autonomy).
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: In 1996 the Tyrol–South Tyrol–Trentino [Euroregion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrol%E2%80%93South_Tyrol%E2%80%93Trentino_Euroregion) was established to account for conflicting identity issues.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: Many Catalans want to have their own state.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.1.3. Pro: There is a party that is demanding an independent Bavarian state.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.1.3.1. Con: The Bayernpartei is politically irrelevant and Bavaria is a part of the Federal Republic of Germany.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: The party being irrelevant does not mean that there are no people with such desire.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: In democracies \(which Bavaria/Germany claim to be\) the expression for political desires are elections. If parties with unique political agendas \(which fulfills - on paper - the desires that seem to be around\) are voted into irrelevance, then the political stance of that party obviously seems to be irrelevant as well.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.1.4. Pro: The partition of Belgium is still discussed by some people.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.1.4.1. Con: The partition by Belgium was neither wanted by the majority of Flaams nor Waloons.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: Only [splinter groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_Belgium#Flemish_movement), such as Vlaams Belang, argued for an independent nation.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: In the 1990s, Vlaams Belang gained at most [10% in elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_Belgium#21st_century_position_of_the_political_parties) and, thus, did not represent a majority.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.1.4.1.2. Pro: The Christian Democrats, the Liberals and the Socialists, as well as the Green parties, usually [refuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_Belgium#21st_century_position_of_the_political_parties) to speak openly about a possible partitioning of Belgium.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.1.4.1.3. Con: The minority that supports division of Belgium does not identify itself with the national state. Even if they are outvoted by a majority, their desire is still there.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.1.5. Pro: Basque people want their own independent state.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.2. Con: Europe has a common history.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.2.1. Con: Europe´s history was and is up until today the combined history of empires and nations, which were working against each other for hegemony. Even still under the first attempt of an unified Europe without national hegemony \(on paper\), there are still discussions on what country dominates Europe and why. There is no such thing as "common history" in terms of Europe, except the project of the EU.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Even though at war, leaders' names are household names across the continent. Charlegmagne, Napolean, Hitler, Joan of Arc, Stalin, Truman, etc.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.2.1.2. Con: Just like any nation state has many subhistories that contest with each other in a [narcissism of minor differences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissism_of_small_differences) so does Europe. Thus national history and European history can integrate.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.2.1.3. Con: A European common history exists if people decide to believe in it. It does not result from actual facts.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.2.1.3.1. Pro: As nations are [imagined communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagined_community), Europe can be an imagined unit with one common history.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.2.2. Pro: There are common European [Lieux de Memoire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_space_\(social_science\)).
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: The concentration camps are part of [common](http://www.ghi-dc.org/files/publications/bulletin/bu040/011.pdf) European memory.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.2.2.2. Pro: The fall of the Iron Curtain is a common historical moment for all Europeans.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.2.2.3. Con: The [conception](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=Vz73BgAAQBAJ&pg=PA75&lpg=PA75&dq=european+lieux+de+memoire&source=bl&ots=U-WztskZJx&sig=vVsPtaHcFpqWRcOuLNasTaIJMLE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiLqJeh4ZTLAhXDNJQKHXpLBwkQ6AEILTAD#v=onepage&q&f=false) of lieux de memoire did not reach Eastern European countries in academia, thus there cannot be a common understanding of it.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.2.2.3.1. Con: Eastern Europeans do not need to have an own conception as long as they adopt the Western European views on lieux de memoire.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.2.3. Pro: Europe shares the history of dominating other continents.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.2.4. Pro: Europe has its common [founding fathers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_fathers_of_the_European_Union) with Robert Schuman and Jean Monet.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.2.5. Pro: The history of Christianity is common to all European countries.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.2.6. Pro: Europe has its creation myth in the destruction of the First and Second World War.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.2.7. Pro: Europeans share the memory of economic development.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.2.8. Con: History is subject to contesting interpretations and thus conflicting. This excludes the creation of a common history.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.2.8.1. Pro: Especially many Central and Eastern European states do fight over [historic interpretations](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=Vz73BgAAQBAJ&pg=PA75&lpg=PA75&dq=european+lieux+de+memoire&source=bl&ots=U-WztskZJx&sig=vVsPtaHcFpqWRcOuLNasTaIJMLE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiLqJeh4ZTLAhXDNJQKHXpLBwkQ6AEILTAD#v=onepage&q&f=false).
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.3. Con: With English, Europe has a common language that acts similar to regional dialects in a national setting. Not superseding them but being in use once necessary.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.4. Con: There is clearly a European heritage in form of architecture, art, literature, etc.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.5. Con: Most nation states that were formed in the 19th century did neither have a common language nor a common constitution. It was possible to create them from above.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.5.1. Pro: In the 19th century only [500.000](https://keimena11.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/hobsbawm_nations_and_nationalism_since_1780.pdf) Germans were able to speak and read Standard German, it was 99% in 1990. Accordingly, local stories disappeared.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.5.2. Pro: When Italy unified in 1860 only [2.5%](https://keimena11.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/hobsbawm_nations_and_nationalism_since_1780.pdf) of Italians spoke Italian. All other dialects and languages were extinguished in the process of media integration at the national level.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.6. Pro: There is no significant European wide media that has replaced the national one.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.6.1. Pro: Media standardizes languages and connects individuals and their life paths.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.6.2. Con: There are Arte, Euronews and Eurosport TV Channels.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.6.2.1. Con: Arte, Euronews and Eurosport are very focused on a particular clientele and thus do not appeal to a wider audience outside this niche.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.6.2.1.1. Pro: Arte's and Eurosports' [audience share](http://www.kek-online.de/medienkonzentration/zuschaueranteile.html) in Germany is only 1% and 0.7% and thus less than Sat 1 Gold \(1.4%\) and KIKA \(1.1%\). Euronews is not even represented seperately but ranks just under 'others'.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.6.2.1.2. Con: Arte covers a wide range of topics, including art and documentaries. This makes it appealing to more than just a niche.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.6.3. Pro: There are no common European shows emerging, such as European farmers match making or a European survivor camp.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.6.3.1. Con: The Eurovision Song Contest is the longest-running annual TV song competition, held, primarily, among the member countries of the European Broadcasting Union \(EBU\) since 1956.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1.6.4. Con: European soccer is broadcasted across the continent.
1.1.2.1.4.2. Con: It is possibile that many identities coexists next to each other. The European one would just add; not destroy a layer.
1.1.2.1.4.2.1. Pro: People typically have many identities that are created vis-a-vis their other, such as city, region, state, nation, continent, etc. That the European identity is strengthened does not change the identification at other levels.
1.1.2.1.4.2.2. Pro: There are many federally organized national states which did not destroy the identities of their federal states.
1.1.2.1.4.2.2.1. Con: Nation-making did destroy regional identities.
1.1.2.1.4.2.2.1.1. Pro: Regional languages, such as [Breton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breton_language), were second ranked over the national language and therefore declined over time.
1.1.2.1.4.2.2.2. Pro: Regional identities remain as stereotypes in the national discourse. Thus they do not disappear.
1.1.2.1.4.2.2.2.1. Pro: English [regional stereotypes](http://de.slideshare.net/ellesullivan310/lesson-19-regional-and-national-identity) are very elaborated.
1.1.2.1.4.2.2.3. Pro: The German national state did not destroy the many identities of its actual 16 diverse federal states \("Bundesländer"\), each with its very own traditions, habits and dialects of German language.
1.1.2.1.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.1.3.1.
1.1.2.1.4.4. Pro: Nation-making eliminated or reduced the influence of regional identities. Analogues, nations will slowly perish with EU integration.
1.1.2.1.4.5. Con: The EU is encouraging a devolution from national to regional identity; not a one size fits all identity.
1.1.2.1.4.5.1. Pro: The creation of a European identity has helped [Crete identity](http://www.lse.ac.uk/europeanInstitute/research/hellenicObservatory/pdf/4th_%20Symposium/PAPERS_PPS/NATIONAL_REGIONAL_IDENTITY/TRUSNER.pdf) to emerge vis-á-vis a national Greek identity.
1.1.2.1.4.6. Pro: In the 1990s, the third most important [concern](http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb38/eb38_en.pdf) about the Single Market was the loss of national identity.
1.1.2.1.4.7. Pro: The universalism of the European interpretation of Human Rights seems to threaten the interpretation of very conservative/right-winged parties and their voters.
1.1.2.1.5. Con: Europeans in the 1990s did neither [trust](http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb48/eb48_en.pdf) nor were they satisfied with the EU.
1.1.2.1.5.1. Con: Europeans in the 1990s expected and wanted a [more important role](http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb48/eb48_en.pdf) for the EU in the 21st century. This indicates fundamental trust and satisfaction.
1.1.2.1.5.2. Con: Europeans wanted an increased role of the [European Parliament](http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb48/eb48_en.pdf). This indicates there are institutions within the EU people trusted.
1.1.2.1.6. Pro: The EU-funded project [ERASMUS](https://www.utwente.nl/bms/cheps/summer_school/literature/internationalisation.pdf) has enhanced student mobility.
1.1.2.1.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.1.
1.1.2.1.8. Pro: Since the EU was founded, there were no wars between the member states.
1.1.2.1.8.1. Con: In the 1890s there was no war between major European powers.
1.1.2.1.8.1.1. Con: The atmosphere among European powers was tense and conflict a latent possibility. This was visible in the Anglo-German naval [arms race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-German_naval_arms_race), treaties, such as the [Entente Cordiale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entente_Cordiale), and clashes about colonial territories, for example the [Tangier Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Moroccan_Crisis) of 1905.
1.1.2.2. Pro: The United Nations helped to develop a protection of Human Rights in Europe.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: European Human Rights legislation is based upon the [UN Human Right's Charter](http://www.europe.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/EU_and_International_Law.pdf).
1.1.2.3. Pro: The [Organisation for Security and Cooperation](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=ZjZvwgv5O6sC&pg=PA1971&lpg=PA1971&dq=organisation+for+security+and+cooperation+in+europe+performance&source=bl&ots=rn7vyNEvtK&sig=cpA9TEo0Kdg_XL7fGESXmGa_4CA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjq27jeyKDLAhWFkKYKHXNoApkQ6AEIMjAE#v=onepage&q&f=false) fostered peace in Europe.
1.1.2.4. Pro: International finance [institutions](https://ideas.repec.org/p/pas/papers/2014-15.html) improved the economic performance of European economies.
1.1.2.4.1. Pro: [GATT](http://www.nber.org/papers/w4944) helped to prevent the erection of new tariffs and led to trade liberalization.
1.1.2.5. Con: By 1890, a common institution was not needed to create deeper integration in trade, travelling and transport because this was already reached.
1.1.2.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.1.1.3.
1.1.3. Pro: The rule of law was strengthened and created a sphere of security for individuals.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Political repression in the 19th century was much harsher than in the 1990s.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: Mass killings or random executions were very [rare](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=zYLR_ewddRoC&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100&dq=average+stores+19th+century+euro&source=bl&ots=-qhsKAoozy&sig=By4I_-DV0DkyLqUVGxhPDnrc6BY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjyy4rnupvLAhUBwZQKHTYVApgQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&q&f=false) in 19th century Europe.

1.1.3.1.2.2. Pro: There was a [class biased](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=zYLR_ewddRoC&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100&dq=average+stores+19th+century+euro&source=bl&ots=-qhsKAoozy&sig=By4I_-DV0DkyLqUVGxhPDnrc6BY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjyy4rnupvLAhUBwZQKHTYVApgQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&q&f=false) suffrage system based on tax contribution that excluded the underprivileged.
1.1.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: In France [99%](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=zYLR_ewddRoC&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100&dq=average+stores+19th+century+euro&source=bl&ots=-qhsKAoozy&sig=By4I_-DV0DkyLqUVGxhPDnrc6BY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjyy4rnupvLAhUBwZQKHTYVApgQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&q&f=false) of males were discriminated against due to tax based voting systems before 1848.
1.1.3.1.2.2.2. Pro: At the time a suffrage system based on tax contribution was judged as good because more rich people were represented.
1.1.3.1.2.2.2.1. Pro: In Prussia and Russia, it was judged that [wealthy people](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=zYLR_ewddRoC&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100&dq=average+stores+19th+century+euro&source=bl&ots=-qhsKAoozy&sig=By4I_-DV0DkyLqUVGxhPDnrc6BY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjyy4rnupvLAhUBwZQKHTYVApgQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&q&f=false) are more important to the state and thus should be allowed to have more influence.
1.1.3.1.2.2.2.2. Pro: Across the continent it was generally held that [poor people](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=zYLR_ewddRoC&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100&dq=average+stores+19th+century+euro&source=bl&ots=-qhsKAoozy&sig=By4I_-DV0DkyLqUVGxhPDnrc6BY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjyy4rnupvLAhUBwZQKHTYVApgQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&q&f=false) are stupid and thus should be not equally represented in elections.
1.1.3.1.2.2.2.3. Pro: It was [common knowledge](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=zYLR_ewddRoC&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100&dq=average+stores+19th+century+euro&source=bl&ots=-qhsKAoozy&sig=By4I_-DV0DkyLqUVGxhPDnrc6BY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjyy4rnupvLAhUBwZQKHTYVApgQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&q&f=false) at that time that only the wealthy would have sufficient leisure time to consider political options and thus are in a position to make adequate decisions.
1.1.3.1.2.2.2.4. Pro: [Arguments](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=zYLR_ewddRoC&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100&dq=average+stores+19th+century+euro&source=bl&ots=-qhsKAoozy&sig=By4I_-DV0DkyLqUVGxhPDnrc6BY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjyy4rnupvLAhUBwZQKHTYVApgQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&q&f=false) were made that the wealthy are more disinterested from gains from the state than the poor and thus are more ethical in their decisions.
1.1.3.1.2.2.3. Pro: Voting for Lower Legislation Chambers typically was only possible if a man possessed [sufficient property](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=zYLR_ewddRoC&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100&dq=average+stores+19th+century+euro&source=bl&ots=-qhsKAoozy&sig=By4I_-DV0DkyLqUVGxhPDnrc6BY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjyy4rnupvLAhUBwZQKHTYVApgQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&q&f=false).
1.1.3.1.2.2.4. Pro: In [19th century Spain](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=zYLR_ewddRoC&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100&dq=average+stores+19th+century+euro&source=bl&ots=-qhsKAoozy&sig=By4I_-DV0DkyLqUVGxhPDnrc6BY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjyy4rnupvLAhUBwZQKHTYVApgQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&q&f=false), only around 20% of the population was allowed to vote.
1.1.3.1.2.3. Pro: [Indirect voting](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=zYLR_ewddRoC&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100&dq=average+stores+19th+century+euro&source=bl&ots=-qhsKAoozy&sig=By4I_-DV0DkyLqUVGxhPDnrc6BY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjyy4rnupvLAhUBwZQKHTYVApgQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&q&f=false) through electors was prevalent to ensure that only 'well-known' candidates would be eligible for the legislature.
1.1.3.1.2.3.1. Con: This in itself is not undemocratic as the same system was applied in the [US](http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/W/bo11315021.html) and transformed quickly because these electors had no independent power.
1.1.3.1.2.4. Pro: High minimum [age threshold](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=zYLR_ewddRoC&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100&dq=average+stores+19th+century+euro&source=bl&ots=-qhsKAoozy&sig=By4I_-DV0DkyLqUVGxhPDnrc6BY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjyy4rnupvLAhUBwZQKHTYVApgQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&q&f=false) excluded a significant part of the population.

1.1.3.1.2.5.1.2. Pro: In [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony_disenfranchisement#United_Kingdom), the most serious offenses involved the loss of voting rights.
1.1.3.1.2.5.1.3. Pro: In [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony_disenfranchisement#United_Kingdom), upon special court order only, those convicted of electoral fraud and crimes undermining the democratic order are barred from voting while in prison.
1.1.3.1.2.5.2. Pro: It was considered unconstitutional for the [British Sovereign](https://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandGovernment/Queenandvoting.aspx) and his or her heir to vote.
1.1.3.1.2.5.3. Pro: The citizens of [Gibraltar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthews_v_United_Kingdom) were excluded from voting for the European Parliament in the 1990s.
1.1.3.1.2.6. Pro: French army [personnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffrage#Function) was prohibited from voting.
1.1.3.1.3. Pro: The freedom of press was limited and therewith prevented adequate policy discussions.
1.1.3.1.3.1. Pro: [Censorship](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=zYLR_ewddRoC&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100&dq=average+stores+19th+century+euro&source=bl&ots=-qhsKAoozy&sig=By4I_-DV0DkyLqUVGxhPDnrc6BY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjyy4rnupvLAhUBwZQKHTYVApgQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&q&f=false) was widespread and therewith limited political expression.
1.1.3.1.3.2. Pro: [Newspapers](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=zYLR_ewddRoC&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100&dq=average+stores+19th+century+euro&source=bl&ots=-qhsKAoozy&sig=By4I_-DV0DkyLqUVGxhPDnrc6BY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjyy4rnupvLAhUBwZQKHTYVApgQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&q&f=false) were often obliged to pay special taxes or deposit securities so they would not violate state interests. This encouraged self-censorship.
1.1.3.1.3.3. Pro: The vagueness of censorship laws induced [self-censorship](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=zYLR_ewddRoC&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100&dq=average+stores+19th+century+euro&source=bl&ots=-qhsKAoozy&sig=By4I_-DV0DkyLqUVGxhPDnrc6BY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjyy4rnupvLAhUBwZQKHTYVApgQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&q&f=false) because journalists could not be aware of what was acceptable.
1.1.3.1.4. Pro: Assembly and association rights were [restricted](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=zYLR_ewddRoC&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100&dq=average+stores+19th+century+euro&source=bl&ots=-qhsKAoozy&sig=By4I_-DV0DkyLqUVGxhPDnrc6BY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjyy4rnupvLAhUBwZQKHTYVApgQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&q&f=false), which favored the status quo.
1.1.3.1.5. Pro: Strikes and trade unions were restricted which aggravated the ply of labor.
1.1.3.1.5.1. Pro: In Italy, Spain, Portugal, Hungary and Russia it was not legal to form a trade [union](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=zYLR_ewddRoC&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100&dq=average+stores+19th+century+euro&source=bl&ots=-qhsKAoozy&sig=By4I_-DV0DkyLqUVGxhPDnrc6BY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjyy4rnupvLAhUBwZQKHTYVApgQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&q&f=false) until the early 20th century.
1.1.3.1.5.2. Pro: Most [European](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=zYLR_ewddRoC&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100&dq=average+stores+19th+century+euro&source=bl&ots=-qhsKAoozy&sig=By4I_-DV0DkyLqUVGxhPDnrc6BY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjyy4rnupvLAhUBwZQKHTYVApgQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&q&f=false) countries even after liberalization did not grant meaningful freedom of union activities by continued harassment.
1.1.3.1.6. Pro: Secret police techniques were widespread to silence dissidents.
1.1.3.1.6.1. Pro: '[Dirty tricks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_tricks)' were widespread in [19th century Europe](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=zYLR_ewddRoC&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100&dq=average+stores+19th+century+euro&source=bl&ots=-qhsKAoozy&sig=By4I_-DV0DkyLqUVGxhPDnrc6BY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjyy4rnupvLAhUBwZQKHTYVApgQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&q&f=false).
1.1.3.1.6.2. Pro: Public [surveillance](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=zYLR_ewddRoC&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100&dq=average+stores+19th+century+euro&source=bl&ots=-qhsKAoozy&sig=By4I_-DV0DkyLqUVGxhPDnrc6BY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjyy4rnupvLAhUBwZQKHTYVApgQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&q&f=false) made it dangerous to talk about the state publicly.
1.1.3.1.6.3. Pro: Secret police sent agents abroad to spy on the [political opposition](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=zYLR_ewddRoC&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100&dq=average+stores+19th+century+euro&source=bl&ots=-qhsKAoozy&sig=By4I_-DV0DkyLqUVGxhPDnrc6BY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjyy4rnupvLAhUBwZQKHTYVApgQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&q&f=false) living in exile.
1.1.3.1.7. Pro: Academic freedom was [limited](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=zYLR_ewddRoC&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100&dq=average+stores+19th+century+euro&source=bl&ots=-qhsKAoozy&sig=By4I_-DV0DkyLqUVGxhPDnrc6BY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjyy4rnupvLAhUBwZQKHTYVApgQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&q&f=false) to induce a certain way of thinking.
1.1.3.1.8. Con: After the 1870s, lower classes were able to gain a certain degree of [political influence](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=zYLR_ewddRoC&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100&dq=average+stores+19th+century+euro&source=bl&ots=-qhsKAoozy&sig=By4I_-DV0DkyLqUVGxhPDnrc6BY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjyy4rnupvLAhUBwZQKHTYVApgQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&q&f=false).
1.1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.5.2.
1.1.3.3. Con: Globalization made it even harder for states to actually enforce their laws, for example against [transnational criminality](http://www.cfr.org/transnational-crime/globalization-affects-transnational-crime/p28403) \(trafficking, smuggling\) and [tax evasion](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=2KZQabqIOkoC&pg=PR4&dq=Tax+Havens:+How+Globalization+Really+Works&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false).
1.1.3.4. Con: Crime rates increased in Europe between the 1890s and 1990s.
1.1.3.4.1. Con: [Homicide rates](http://ourworldindata.org/data/violence-rights/homicides/) have declined since 1890 making society safer for individuals.
1.1.3.4.1.1. Con: Homicide rates in [England and Wales](http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/RP99-111#fullreport) increased between 1900 and 1997.
1.1.3.4.1.1.1. Con: We need to keep our sight on the word "Europe" - statistics for some fairly small regions are useless at best and manipulative at worst. \("Fairly small" compared to the accepted geographical definition of Europe as stretching from the Urals to the North Pole to Malta, etc.\)
1.1.3.4.1.2. Pro: Violence has been declining since the 1890s, as is evident in the development of [homicide rates](https://ourworldindata.org/homicides/) in major European countries which halved.
1.1.3.4.1.2.1. Con: Statistics show that there has been a [U-shaped pattern](http://www.vrc.crim.cam.ac.uk/vrcresearch/paperdownload/manuel-eisner-historical-trends-in-violence.pdf) in terms of European homicide rates that saw them decreasing from the late 19th century until 1950, and once again rising until the end of the 20th century.
1.1.3.4.2. Pro: In the [UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/historical-crime-data) the number of cases of violence across all sections rose by a factor of 30 between the 1890s and the 1990s even though the population only grew by 1.5.
1.1.3.4.2.1. Pro: Cases of [violence](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/historical-crime-data) against a person rose from 2,144 in 1898 to 256,000 in 1989.
1.1.3.4.2.2. Pro: The number of total [sexual offences](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/historical-crime-data) increased from 1,723 in 1898 to 34,000 in 1989.
1.1.3.4.2.3. Pro: The number of cases involving [theft or burglary](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/historical-crime-data) increased from 63,000 in 1898 to 2,144,000 in 1989.
1.1.3.4.2.4. Con: The source explicitly states that these numbers "are affected by changes in levels of reporting to the police and recording by them". They might thus say little about actual crime rates.
1.1.3.4.2.4.1. Con: The crimes rates increased by a factor of 30 or more. This means that to offset the crime levels crime reporting would have to improve by a similar factor.
1.1.3.4.2.4.1.1. Pro: Despite significant technological improvements between [1973 and 2005](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-9125.2010.00182.x/abstract) the crime reporting rate increased not even by a factor of 2. Thus we can estimate that the changes will not reach a magnitude of 30 between the 1890s and the 1990s.
1.1.3.4.2.5. Pro: Even if adjusted for [population growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_Kingdom#UK_population_change_over_time) which doubled between 1900 and 2000 the increases are still stronger than population increases.
1.1.3.4.3. Pro: The number of [recorded crimes](https://chs.revues.org/989) increased drastically since the 1890s.
1.1.3.4.3.1. Con: Recording of crime rates can increase due to factors unrelated to actual violence, such as more trust in the police or better recording systems.
1.1.3.4.4. Pro: Criminality levels of [theft and violence](http://jessnevins.com/blog/?p=89) have been dramatically reduced by the 1890s already. Thus, no major change in individual security is observable by the 1990s.
1.1.3.5. Pro: With Human Rights there was a minimum standard introduced to rely upon.
1.1.3.6. Pro: Humanitarian law was introduced, giving individual protection even in times of war.
1.1.4. Pro: The abolishment of monarchies improved many peoples' lives.
1.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.1.4.2. Pro: Legal developments led to a more equal society and thus profited Europeans' life.
1.1.4.2.1. Pro: Equal rights improved womens' quality of life.
1.1.4.2.1.1. Pro: Women could decide independently if they want to work.
1.1.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: Women increasingly have entered the [labor market](https://books.google.co.kr/books?hl=en&lr=&id=U8Du1ErYPC0C&oi=fnd&pg=PR1&dq=reproductive+work+women+europe&ots=r73z1zecV2&sig=wCVQdFRyqPSs61cAjl_OziOvVIA#v=onepage&q=reproductive%20work%20women%20europe&f=false) since 1900.
1.1.4.2.1.2. Pro: Women could choose if they want to have children.
1.1.4.2.1.2.1. Pro: The invention of the birth control pill in the 1960s improved family planning and strenghtened womens' rights by giving them control over their fertility.
1.1.4.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: [Side effects](http://www.glowm.com/section_view/item/375) of the Pill reduced during the 20th century.
1.1.4.2.1.2.2. Pro: Women could get abortions legally.
1.1.4.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: This severely lowered the health risks of unsafe illegal abortions.
1.1.4.2.1.2.2.2. Pro: Abortions in most European countries were [illegal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_law) in the 19th century.
1.1.4.2.1.2.2.2.1. Pro: According to Art 218 Reichsstrafgesetzbuch, in Prussia abortion was illegal after 1871.
1.1.4.2.1.2.2.2.2. Pro: Abortions in the [UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malicious_Shooting_or_Stabbing_Act_1803) were made illegal in the beginning of the 19th century.
1.1.4.2.1.2.2.2.3. Pro: Making women criminals for having an abortion is bad for their mental health.
1.1.4.2.1.2.2.2.3.1. Con: In [France](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11614490) the notion was thought of a thinkable solution for unwanted pregnancy.
1.1.4.2.1.3. Pro: Women got full voting rights which enabled them to participate politically.
1.1.4.2.1.4. Con: Through the equality movement, women have experienced a reduction in the quality of life.
1.1.4.2.1.4.1. Pro: With the right to work, women do experience [double burdens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_burden) of commercial and domestic work.
1.1.4.2.1.4.1.1. Con: On average, women and men across Europe perform the same total number of productive work hours. The idea of double burden is a [myth](http://www.lse.ac.uk/newsAndMedia/news/archives/2010/08/CatherineHakimRenewal.pdf).
1.1.4.2.1.4.1.2. Pro: The [double burden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_burden#Health_effects) of women increases women's stress level, the mortality rate, the work intensity and a loss in sleep.
1.1.4.2.1.4.1.3. Con: The double burden results from the lack of childcare institutions, not from womens' right to work.
1.1.4.2.1.4.1.3.1. Pro: In Europe the main reason for women to abstain from a full time position is the [need to take care](http://s3.amazonaws.com/zanran_storage/stuwww.uvt.nl/ContentPages/51710139.pdf) of children and the elderly.
1.1.4.2.1.4.1.3.2. Con: What seems to be successful in [Sweden](http://europa.eu/epic/countries/sweden/index_en.htm) is flexible parental leave and not the provision of childcare institutions.
1.1.4.2.1.4.2. Pro: Women increasingly participated in warfare activities of men.
1.1.4.2.1.4.2.1. Pro: It was since the Crimean War that [nursing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_nursing) became increasingly widespread through the activities of Florence Nightingale.
1.1.4.2.1.4.2.2. Pro: In the two World Wars it became established that [women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_the_World_Wars) contribute to war efforts through work in factories.
1.1.4.2.1.4.2.3. Pro: Female combat participation became a possible scenario for many societies.
1.1.4.2.1.4.2.3.1. Pro: In [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_World_War_II) female participation in combat activities became widespread across the continent.
1.1.4.2.1.4.2.3.2. Pro: Initial steps for female participation in warfare were laid in [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_World_War_I).
1.1.4.2.1.4.2.3.3. Pro: The 20th century saw the gradual expansion of possibilities for regular [female service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_the_military_by_country#Europe) in the armed forces across the continent.
1.1.4.2.1.4.2.3.3.1. Con: Women are not allowed to join the [special forces](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/11832806/Action-woman-puts-male-competitors-to-shame-in-gruelling-Special-Forces-training.html) in the UK.
1.1.4.2.1.4.2.3.3.2. Con: Military service is not bad for women who decide for themselves that they want to do it.
1.1.4.2.1.5. Con: In many aspects of gender equality not much has changed between 1890 and 1990.
1.1.4.2.1.5.1. Pro: Of those who lived in [poverty](http://www.helsinki.fi/science/xantippa/wle/wle13.html) 70% were women. Thus, it is still women who suffer most.
1.1.4.2.1.5.2. Pro: Equal rights have changed little about the gender pay [gap](http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/sites/default/files/documents/research/gender_pay_gap_briefing_paper2.pdf).

1.1.4.2.1.8.1. Con: The European Convention on Human Rights has more favorable conditions and was signed earlier. Thus, the Vienna Declaration \([VDPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Declaration_and_Programme_of_Action)\) of 1993 made no difference for the life of Europeans.
1.1.4.2.1.8.1.1. Con: Even though the provisions were stricter there was no actual ruling [before 1993](http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/FS_Domestic_violence_ENG.pdf).

Pro: It was in 1975 that the European Convention on the Legal Status of [illegitimate children](http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/085) was agreed upon, trying to improve the legal status of illegitimate children.

1.1.4.2.3.1.1. Pro: The voice of minorities was more influential because the communities were smaller.
1.1.4.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: In small communities opinions of the small minority are more likely to be consistent since the group size is smaller. This makes minority groups more influential.

1.1.4.2.3.1.1.4. Con: In the 1890s, the unifying forces of nation-making were much stronger than in the 1990s. This marginalized the interests of minorities.
1.1.4.2.3.1.1.4.1. Pro: After the 1870 unification of Germany there was a strong [Germanization pressure](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=sH5qCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA54&lpg=PA54&dq=lohsa+sorbs&source=bl&ots=DArt6edxUv&sig=ndCbv-h4cZqkWCmc0zgWRscIqTk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjRmIzFuJvLAhXmJaYKHagjCJoQ6AEIMTAF#v=onepage&q&f=false) on minorities, such as the Sorbs.
1.1.4.2.3.1.2. Pro: [Centralization](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=3894544) was, even in established nation states, not very far by the mid 19th century.
1.1.4.2.3.1.3. Con: Decentralization allows discrimination to be underreported because there is no big information community.
1.1.4.2.3.2. Pro: The disability rights movement contributed to an understanding of people with disabilities \(including not to be called 'disabled'\) as a minority or a coalition of minorities who are disadvantaged by society, not just as people who are disadvantaged by their impairments.

1.1.4.2.3.2.2. Pro: The [disability rights movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_disability_rights_outside_the_United_States) only arose in the second half of the 20th century.

1.1.4.2.3.3.1.1.3. Pro: Corporal punishment was not made illegal in Romania [until 2004](http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/CRC_Impact_summaryreport.pdf).
1.1.4.2.3.3.1.1.4. Pro: During the 1990s the UK has kept opt-outs of the [Children Rights Convention](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7624450.stm) that discriminate against migrant children.

1.1.4.2.3.3.1.1.6.2. Pro: All attempts of the EU and the Council of Europe to provide for children laws were piecemeal in the 1990s. Thus the convention served as a lowest common [denominator](http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Handbook_rights_child_ENG.pdf).
1.1.4.2.3.3.1.1.6.3. Pro: The European Court of Human Rights ruled that the [convention](http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-61194#{"itemid":\["001-61194"\]}) sets the minimum standard all European governments have to adhere to.

1.1.4.2.3.4.2.1. Pro: In 1886 Bismark expelled Roma and Sinti because of the "[mischief caused by families of Gypsies](http://www.radoc.net/radoc.php?doc=art_b_history_rootsofprejudice&lang=en&articles=true)".  By 1990 they were still [targets](http://hatecrime.osce.org/what-hate-crime/bias-against-roma-and-sinti) of violent attacks all over Europe.

1.1.4.2.3.5. Con: The [millet system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_Millet) of the Ottoman allowed for the aquisition of independent political power on the Balkan. Minority rights on the Balkan in 1990 helped little in contrast.

1.1.4.2.4.4.1. Pro: [The costs](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-surging-cost-of-raising-a-kid-in-two-charts-2012-6?IR=T) of raising a child grew between 1960 and 2010. From this we can infere that raising a child in 1890 was cheaper than in 1990.

1.1.4.2.6.1.3.2. Pro: Men are [more likely](http://www.womensmediacenter.com/pages/the-problem) to be quoted than women in the media, and more likely to cover "serious" topics.

1.1.7.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Because costs of medical services are low and do not have to be carried alone by the patient and in general better medical treatments were developed to treat all kinds of medical problems, the body is exposed to threats such as alcohol, smoking, unhealthy diets, etc., which to a huge amount depend on the habits of the consumer.
1.1.7.3.1.1.1.2. Con: More thorough education of medical staff led to a wider knowledge of health issues in the 1990s.
1.1.7.3.1.1.1.3. Con: [Body cultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_culture_studies) transformed and remain relevant today. This shows that individuals remain conscious about their own body.

1.1.7.3.1.1.3.4.1.5.2.4.10.1. Pro: Raw soybeans, from which soy sauce is made, are also toxic. Industrial soy sauce is made from acid-hydrolyzed vegetable protein, not boiled soybeans.
1.1.7.3.1.1.3.4.1.5.2.4.10.2. Pro: Traces of cyanide can be found in almond flavor, or Benzaldehyde, when derived from nature.
1.1.7.3.1.1.3.4.1.5.2.4.10.3. Pro: Artificial flavors often undergo even stricter safety evaluations than natural flavors.
1.1.7.3.1.1.3.4.1.5.2.4.11. Pro: In order to achieve "tasty artificially engineered food" flavor enhancers like monosodium glutamate \(MSG\) are used extensively. Headache, flushing, numbness, nausea, rapid flattering heartbeats and some other symptoms after consuming MSG are summarized as the MSG [symptom complex](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/monosodium-glutamate/faq-20058196).
1.1.7.3.1.1.3.4.1.5.2.4.11.1. Con: Usually the MSG symptoms are [mild](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/monosodium-glutamate/faq-20058196) and no medical treatment is needed.
1.1.7.3.1.1.3.4.1.5.2.4.11.2. Con: Researchers have not found any concrete [evidences](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/monosodium-glutamate/faq-20058196) of a connection between the symptom complex and MSG.

1.1.7.3.1.1.3.4.1.5.2.4.11.4. Pro: A [scientific experiment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10644540) has shown that fifteen minutes after ingesting MSG the blood serum insulin increase threefold. It takes more than 100 minutes to get to normal levels again. This happens in abscence of ingesting \(carbohydrate\) glucose. Maybe for some the insulin cascading effect is mild, but for others it could be debilitating.
1.1.7.3.1.1.3.4.1.5.2.4.11.4.1. Pro: Moments of acute higher serum insulin drives hunger, may lead to eating more \(carbohydrate\) convenience food and snacking. Insulin also drives glucose once changed by the liver into fat into the fat cells of adipose tissue, thus a cause for obesity.
1.1.7.3.1.1.3.4.1.5.3. Pro: MSGs where invented by [Kikuna Ikeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kikunae_Ikeda) at the beginning of the 20th century only. Thus, there was little impact in the 19th century.

1.1.7.3.1.1.3.4.1.5.4.1.2. Pro: Vanilla sugar does contain mostly vanilla aroma instead of real vanilla. That is why the non-ecological one is so much cheaper.
1.1.7.3.1.1.3.4.1.5.4.2. Con: The only effects of food colors are to make it more attractive. This does not reduce the price.
1.1.7.3.1.1.3.4.1.5.4.3. Pro: European households only spent [14%](http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/trends-in-share-of-expenditure-1/assessment) of their income on food and non-alcoholic beverages. This shows the need for cheap food products.
1.1.7.3.1.1.3.4.1.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.3.1.1.3.4.1.5.2.4.
1.1.7.3.1.1.3.4.1.6. Pro: Globalization and international economic trade led to a rise in [food miles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_miles), affecting its quality.

1.1.7.3.1.1.3.4.1.6.1.1. Con: There is a higher chance of fresh foods \(vegetables, fruits, etc.\) rotting, when their transporation is enduring.
1.1.7.3.1.1.3.4.1.6.1.1.1. Con: Without long transportation these fruits would not be enjoyable at all. Thus, half ripened taste is better than no taste.
1.1.7.3.1.1.3.4.1.6.1.2. Con: Fruits from the tropics often have to ripen inside containers while they are shipped to Europe. There is definitely a huge difference in taste between these shipped fruits and those which were able to fully ripen on their mother plants.

1.1.7.3.1.1.3.4.1.7.9.4.1. Pro: [Sodium Nitrite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrite#Nitrite_in_food_preservation_and_biochemistry) is used for the curing of meat because it prevents bacterial growth and, as it is a reducing agent \(opposite of oxidation agent\), in a reaction with the meat's myoglobin, gives the product a desirable pink-red 'fresh' color, such as with corned beef. This use of nitrate goes back to the Middle Ages.
1.1.7.3.1.1.3.4.1.7.9.4.2. Pro: Many foods, like pickles, smoked ham, or cheese, are prepared in the exact same way as in the 1890s.

1.1.7.3.1.1.3.4.1.8.3.1. Con: Not being dependent on seasons \(e.g. having strawberries in the supermarket in February\) leads to long transportation, long storage times, etc. and thus, on top of the quality issues, the climate footprint of those goods are pretty bad.
1.1.7.3.1.1.3.4.1.8.3.1.1. Con: The European economy produces [just in time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_manufacturing#Migration_to_the_West) to avoid long storage times and to be more competitive. This includes food and thus storage times are short.
1.1.7.3.1.1.3.4.1.8.3.1.2. Con: Independence of seasons can also be achieved by the use of greenhouses.
1.1.7.3.1.1.3.4.1.8.3.1.2.1. Con: Out of season production needs [heated](http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/80800000/FTakeda/1999Advances%20in%20Strawberry%20Res%20feature.pdf) plastic houses.

1.1.7.3.1.1.11. Con: Improved communication technology increased the stress level, because everyone was available at most times, due to widespread telephone [landlines](http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2008/07/phones_without_homes.html) and spreading [cell phones](http://www.knowyourmobile.com/nokia/nokia-3310/19848/history-mobile-phones-1973-2008-handsets-made-it-all-happen).

Con: Until 1990 rents [rose](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=s_WFhNrMc1gC&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&dq=munich+rent+1990&source=bl&ots=QsmLYlsoWe&sig=z9a9Pa7q5Q1nc1ITBOTml9K-zLc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjcoKX6iurKAhUBMZQKHRy-AwMQ6AEIJzAB#v=onepage&q=munich%20rent%201990&f=false) in the Western part of Europe making it more difficult to find decent housing conditions.
1.1.7.3.1.3.2. Pro: After significant declines throughout the past century, virtually [no absolute poverty](http://www.cgdev.org/blog/poverty-rich-world-when-it-was-not-nearly-so-rich) exists in Europe anymore.
1.1.7.3.1.3.2.1. Con: While above the standards of developing countries, [up to 6%](http://www.euro.centre.org/data/1226583242_93408.pdf) of the population in Europe's poorest countries live under the absolute poverty rate of 5€/day, and [up to 50%](http://feantsaresearch.all2all.org/IMG/pdf/policy-review-5.pdf) suffer from some form of deprivation.
1.1.7.3.1.3.3. Pro: [Globalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization) allowed for much better trade and capital movement.
1.1.7.3.1.3.3.1. Con: Globalization took jobs in many industries - for example [textile, clothing and footwear](http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_008075/lang--en/index.htm) - from European countries to developing countries.
1.1.7.3.1.3.3.2. Con: Globalization makes countries [vulnerable](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DEC/Resources/32459_Schmukler,_Zoido,_and_Halac_\(Oct2003\).pdf) to international economic crises and financial contagion.
1.1.7.3.1.3.3.2.1. Con: There were no Europe wide financial crises in the 1990s.
1.1.7.3.1.3.3.2.2. Con: Financial crisis existed before globalization, e.g. in the [late 13th century](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/4128072/England-suffered-a-financial-crisis-in-the-Middle-Ages.html).
1.1.7.3.1.3.3.3. Con: Globalization goes hand in hand with the [emergence of tax havens](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=2KZQabqIOkoC&pg=PR4&dq=Tax+Havens:+How+Globalization+Really+Works&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false) that allow companies and rich individuals to evade regulation, skew the benefits of globalization and precipitate financial crises.
1.1.7.3.1.3.3.4. Con: Transnational criminals, smugglers and traffickers have been among the [major beneficiaries](http://www.cfr.org/transnational-crime/globalization-affects-transnational-crime/p28403) of globalization. It makes regulation and law enforcement more difficult, and provides new avenues for evasion and illicit cooperation.
1.1.7.3.1.3.3.5. Con: Globalization undermines states' [tax autonomy](http://pas.sagepub.com/content/30/2/245) and their ability to effectively impose [taxes on mobile factors](http://www.e-jei.org/upload/JEI_20_3_530_542_524.pdf) such as capital.
1.1.7.3.1.3.3.6. Pro: Globalization provides consumers with a [greater variety of goods](https://www.nber.org/papers/w10314) to choose from.
1.1.7.3.1.3.3.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.3.1.1.3.4.1.8.
1.1.7.3.1.3.3.7. Pro: Integration of financial markets and trade helps foster peace.
1.1.7.3.1.3.3.7.1. Pro: Parts of society that are interested in trade will demand that trade flows remain stable and not be disrupted by conflict.
1.1.7.3.1.3.3.7.2. Pro: The GATT/WTO system builds confidence and trust among members by providing a legal framework.
1.1.7.3.1.3.3.7.3. Pro: Market protection contributed to the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1941.
1.1.7.3.1.3.3.7.3.1. Con: There were other factors, like a Japanese identity crisis or dominance of military men, that made them attack Pearl Harbor.
1.1.7.3.1.3.3.7.4. Con: Countries fight, even if their economies are deeply integrated, such as in WWI.
1.1.7.3.1.3.3.8. Pro: Globalization proceeds according to rules which are easier to live with than with a system based on power.
1.1.7.3.1.3.3.9. Pro: Freer trade cuts the cost of living by reducing prices.
1.1.7.3.1.3.3.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.2.2.2.
1.1.7.3.1.3.3.10. Pro: Freer trade raises income, such as those facilitated by the [Uruguay Round](http://www.ub.edu/prometheus21/articulos/archivos/gatt.PDF).
1.1.7.3.1.3.3.11. Pro: Free trade stimulates economic [growth](http://europa.eu/pol/pdf/flipbook/en/trade_en.pdf).
1.1.7.3.1.3.4. Pro: An organized system of state welfare provision \(social security\) was not common back in the 1890s, but it was in the 1990's.
1.1.7.3.1.3.4.1. Pro: Since 1948, [social security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_security#History) is a concept enshrined in Article 22 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
1.1.7.3.1.3.5. Pro: With the abolishment of aristocracy income inequalities were reduced in Europe between the1890s and the 1990s.
1.1.7.3.1.3.5.1. Pro: In [Denmark](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=57nvtVnTUzIC&pg=PA223&lpg=PA223&dq=gini+coefficient+europe+1900&source=bl&ots=NfpkUG2Ipz&sig=ratxgViUEl5F3T1St110cUfVl3A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjjjfrcmITNAhUDJZQKHWxABpwQ6AEIODAI#v=onepage&q&f=false) the Gini coefficient reduced from .50 at the end of the 19th century to .27 in 1963.
1.1.7.3.1.3.5.2. Pro: The [top 1%](https://ourworldindata.org/income-inequality/) share of total income reduced dramatically between 1900 and the 1990s. This indicates that income inequality reduced.
1.1.7.3.1.3.5.3. Pro: The Gini coefficient reduced in the [UK](https://ourworldindata.org/income-inequality/) between 1890s and 1990s.
1.1.7.3.1.3.6. Con: Unemployment rates in major European countries such as the UK, Germany and France were [at least twice higher](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=ssNMAgAAQBAJ&pg=RA4-PA148&lpg=RA4-PA148&dq=unemployment+rates+1890+europe&source=bl&ots=5Tmi-U8bWZ&sig=B6VSQvBhGPWOICdVYB1VUJdCNbs&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiJ08L5j5_NAhVKF5QKHWaWBxsQ6AEINTAD#v=onepage&q=unemployment%20rates%201890%20europe&f=false) in 1990 than in 1890. The percentage of the population living on a self-earned income thus decreased.
1.1.7.3.1.3.6.1. Con: Even if unemployed the [disposable income](http://www.roiw.org/1989/1.pdf) increased for families and therewith strengthened their financial independence.
1.1.7.3.1.4. Pro: The society in the 1990s was more considerate and civilized than in the 1890s and thus better to live in. Citizens enjoyed better legal protection, were nicer towards each other and were taken care of in case of need.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1. Con: In the 1990s mass produced goods were a standard in most European countries, which led to a reckless consumer society that is inhumane towards others.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.1. Pro: Europeans owned more things in the 1990s than in the 1890s.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.2. Con: A reckless society in the 1990s that is exploiting the earth's resources is no harm to Europeans as long as the damages are felt abroad.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.2.1. Con: Damages abroad are going to affect Europeans eventually. Those who suffer the damages will start to emigrate sooner or later - many of them facing Europe.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.2.1.1. Pro: Since the 1990s, Antarctic total column ozone in September and October continued to be 40–50% lower than pre-ozone-hole values \([ozone depletion](http://acdb-ext.gsfc.nasa.gov/Documents/O3_Assessments/Docs/WMO_2010/Q2_QA.pdf)\).
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.2.1.2. Con: There is no [academic](http://www.migrationpolicy.org/pubs/MPIEurope-EnvironmentalMigration.pdf) consensus on the causalities between environmental degradation and migration to Europe. Especially, most modern academics doubt the early findings.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.2.1.3. Con: Europeans in the 1990s did not suffer from the fact that their consumption hurt the environment or other people.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.3. Con: A consumer society is benefitial for Europeans.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.3.1. Pro: There is a great amount of choice to select from for every product.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.3.2. Pro: Stores specialize and therewith reflect buyer preferences.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.3.2.1. Con: Stores were specialized before.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.3.2.2. Con: Lots of goods before the introduction of massproduction were custom made \(e.g. fashion and furniture\).
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.3.2.2.1. Con: Further specialization within sectors is good for the economy because people can buy higher quality products in stores that specialize according to their [comparative advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage).
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.3.3. Pro: The consumer society creates competition and therewith innovation.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.3.4. Pro: A consumer society helps to grow economically without relying on exports alone.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.3.5. Pro: Consumer research emerged as a new field of emplyoment.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.3.6. Pro: Many companies make much money by providing consumer goods.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.4. Con: Consumerism [emerged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumerism#Origins) already in the late 19th century.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.5. Con: The emergence of a consumer society leveled social hierarchies and made everybody more equal. Thus, consumerism is a grand quest for creating an equal society.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.5.1. Pro: Goods become available for the masses and not only for a selected few.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.5.1.1. Pro: It is very easy to get a credit card \(for example the [Amazon credit card](http://www.amazon.com/Credit-Cards/b?node=1266766011)\) or credit financing \(for example [Apple](http://www.apple.com/uk/shop/browse/finance/PaypalFinancingLandingPage)\). Huge retail companies even advertise it.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.5.2. Con: Over-consumption creates individual debt and dependence.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.5.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.3.1.4.1.5.1.1.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.5.2.2. Con: In the 1990s unbalance in debt distribution has not caused problems.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.5.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.3.1.3.3.2.1.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.5.3. Con: The emergence of brands re-establishes a hierarchy within the equalized consumer society.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.5.3.1. Pro: Not everyone can buy very expensive brands and thus need to remain behind in their conspicuous consumption.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.5.3.2. Con: Conspicuous consumption has existed [before](http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/10610420810856495) the advent of a consumer society.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.5.4. Con: Purchase of certain goods allows people to identify like-minded individuals through the display of similar products. This furthers social stratification.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.5.4.1. Con: Professions and social groups had characteristic clothing and items before. Thus, social stratification is no result of consumerism.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.6. Con: If consumerism would be that negative for Europeans then they would simply stop it. Apparently it is not that negative.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.6.1. Pro: In some cases [shopping](http://www.madisonindia.com/media/pdf/WhyPeopleShop.pdf) helps to bust stress or has a recreational effect.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.6.2. Pro: People simply [enjoy](http://qz.com/640729/americans-basically-agree-that-shopping-is-a-great-cure-for-boredom/) shopping.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.6.3. Con: People do a lot of things that are negative for them though they know of the negative consequences.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.6.3.1. Pro: People smoke, drink alcohol, do drugs and eat unhealthy though they know it is bad for their health.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.6.3.2. Con: Behavior with negative consequences is based on rational pro/con analysis. Just that the short term benefits are weighed more heavily. This is even stronger with consumerism where the long term benefits are minimal to the individual.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.6.4. Con: Europeans also simply suppress big food scandals within weeks and keep consuming the same products, because the prices are more important to them than their own health and the environment. Still this is negative to Europeans.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.6.4.1. Con: Food scandals are the exception.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.6.4.2. Con: Food safety authorities work to prevent scandals. They know much better than the consumer.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.6.4.3. Pro: Inedible food is unhealthy.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.7. Pro: A reckless consumer society also has negative consequences for the environment \(in Europe\).
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.7.1. Pro: As the [North Atlantic Garbage Patch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic_garbage_patch) proves, plastic garbage is poisoning the seas, not only far away in the Pacific ocean, but in the Atlantic ocean as well.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.7.1.1. Pro: While eating their normal source of food, plastic ingestion can be unavoidable to wildlife. Thus, many of the fish & seafood Europeans consumed were contaminated.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.7.2. Pro: [Acid rain](https://educnet.enpc.fr/pluginfile.php/5882/mod_resource/content/0/Menz-ESP-2004.pdf) increased in Europe and caused local concerns from the 1970s onwards.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8. Pro: In the 1990s it was possible to produce luxury goods in an industrial fashion, which led to an increasing amount of pretentiousness amongst Europeans.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.1. Con: A widespread feeling of decadence and pretentiousness was observable in late 19th century Europe with the emergence of the [decadent movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decadent_movement).
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.1.1. Con: The Decadent movement was a late 19th-century artistic and literary movement of Western Europe and not connected to consumerism.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.2. Pro: In the 1990s luxury products, such as expensive cars, were mass productions, which led to the suggestion that many more people could afford such a product compared to the 1890s.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.2.1. Con: Most of those "luxury products" did not exist back in the 1890s to begin with.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.2.2. Con: Just because many people can afford a product does not mean there is widespread decadence.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.2.2.1. Pro: It can even lead to less decadence as being able to afford luxury products becomes more "normal" for people.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.2.2.1.1. Pro: More widespread luxury goods are representing a more equal society rather than decadence and pretentiousness.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Originally the term [conspicuous consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspicuous_consumption) only applied to the upper class, but now it was extended to society as a whole indicating that classes become blurred.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3. Con: Luxury goods are not a sign of pretentiousness.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.1. Pro: Luxury goods are often the cheapest alternative in the long run.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.1.1. Con: To some luxury goods, such as a a private jet or a yacht, due to their excessive expensiveness there are only cheaper alternatives.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.2. Pro: It is less decadent and pretentious to buy few upscale fashion items than tons of cheap clothing.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.3. Con: As economically considered "luxury goods" are a contrast to "necessity goods", they are a sign of pretentiousness.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.3.1. Con: Cheap clothing is not a necessity good either.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.3.2. Pro: Necessity goods are goods that we cannot live without and will not likely cut back on even when times are tough, for example food, power, water and gas.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.3.3. Con: People in the 1890s bought lots of things that were no necessity goods too, eg clothing, coffee, chocolate or furniture. Therefore they were not less decadent than people in the 1990s.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.3.3.1. Pro: Since the Napoleonic Wars [coffee](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/22489/1/wp04.pdf) was consumed by urban workers and rural residents.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.3.3.1.1. Con: [Coffee](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/22489/1/wp04.pdf) became a necessary \(and widespread\) good in the late 19th century to cope with the regimented time of urban industrialized societies.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.3.3.2. Pro: [Global coffee consumption](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/22489/1/wp04.pdf) grew more than 15-fold in the 19th century.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.3.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.3.3.1.1.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.3.3.4. Con: -> See 1.1.7.3.1.4.1.1.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.3.3.5. Con: Europeans in 1890 consumed much less coffee than those in 1990.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.3.3.5.1. Pro: [Coffee imports](https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/M07038USM149NNBR) into the US increased drastically since the 1890s. The same trend can be expected for Europe given their parallel economic development and technological progress.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.3.3.5.1.1. Pro: European and US coffee [imports](http://www.web-books.com/Classics/ON/B0/B701/27MB701.html) increased by 2.000.000 bags between 1890 and 1900.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.3.3.5.2. Pro: Coffee was rather expensive in the 1890s while it was affordable in the 1990s. This should have increased the consumption.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.3.3.5.2.1. Pro: In the 1880s, there was a major [disease on Java](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/22489/1/wp04.pdf) reducing the output of coffee leading to a rise in prices.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.3.3.5.2.2. Pro: The [abolition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolition_of_slavery_timeline#1850.E2.80.931899) of slavery in the 19th century led to a sudden increase in labor costs that made coffee beans more expensive.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.3.3.5.2.3. Con: New exporters joined the global market decreasing prices.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.3.3.5.2.3.1. Pro: Brazil's [coffee exports](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/22489/1/wp04.pdf) jumped 75 fold between independence in 1822 and 1899.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.3.3.5.2.3.2. Con: The new capacities were easily matched by the new [market](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/22489/1/wp04.pdf), the US.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.3.3.5.3. Pro: The global coffee [production](http://www.ico.org/news/icc-111-5-r1e-world-coffee-outlook.pdf) doubled between the 1960s and 1990s. Thus we can estimate that the amount of possibly consumed coffee in the 1890s was smaller.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.3.4. Con: Not all luxury goods are signs of pretentiousness because they work as cultural assets.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.3.4.1. Pro: Music instruments, such as pianos, are not necessary but are a distinct feature of culture.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.3.4.2. Pro: Pieces of art \(expensive paintings, sculptures etc.\) may not be necessary, but they can be regarded as cultural assets.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.3.5. Pro: Luxury goods are not necessary to survival and thus increase unnecessary costs on someone else. This is decadent.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.4. Con: Luxury goods, such as expensive wines, jewelry, fashion-designer handbags, and luxury cars, are in demand because of the high prices asked for them. The high price makes the goods desirable as symbols of the buyer's high social status, by way of conspicuous consumption and conspicuous leisure. This is a sign of pretentiousness.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.4.1. Pro: Thorstein Veblen was the first economist who identified conspicuous consumption as a mode of status-seeking and identified specific overpriced goods as [Veblen goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veblen_good).
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.4.1.1. Pro: A perfect example of a Veblen good is the iOS application ["I am rich"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Rich) which is considered to be nothing but decadent having it.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.4.2. Pro: Most Europeans could not afford to buy a Chanel 2.55 in the 1990s.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.4.2.1. Pro: Measured in [GDP/capita](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?page=4), buying a [Chanel 2.55](http://www.racked.com/2014/8/26/7579573/chanel-bag-price-increase) in 1991 would consume about 5% of value an individual citizen had at her disposal.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.4.3. Con: Expensive jewelry, designer handbags or luxury cars are not only bought as a symbol of wealth, but also because of great design and high quality or as an investment.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.4.3.1. Pro: The [Chanel 2.55](http://www.purseblog.com/chanel/10-reasons-to-own-a-chanel-flap-bag/) constantly rises in worth.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.4.3.2. Pro: The [Chanel 2.55](http://www.purseblog.com/chanel/10-reasons-to-own-a-chanel-flap-bag/) gets never out of fashion. You can wear it for all of your life and never need to buy another bag.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.4.3.2.1. Con: A Chanel 2.55 can [break](http://forum.purseblog.com/chanel/my-2-55-strap-is-broken-91977.html) during your life.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.4.3.2.2. Con: A Chanel 2.55 is quite small. A bag to carry more heavy things is required in life.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.4.3.2.3. Con: A hand bag of the same color is not matching to all occasions or other colors. This makes more bags necessary.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.4.3.3. Pro: Haute couture is pure craftmanship and collected by some people not only as clothing items but pieces of art.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.4.3.3.1. Con: Buying clothing not for the prupose of wearing them, but to collect and display them as art is a sign of decadence.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.4.3.3.1.1. Con: It is not decadent to regard fashion as art and valuing great designs.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.4.3.3.1.2. Con: Record collectors do not listen to their most expensive records either. That is not a sign of decadence, but a form of respecting rare pieces of art.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.4.3.3.1.2.1. Con: Owning something but not consuming it out of fear that it will become worthless is decadent, because the product cannot even display its intended purpose.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.4.3.3.1.3. Con: Collecting and displaying certain pieces of clothing as art is not decadent but a sign of great awareness of contemporary culture.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.4.3.3.2. Pro: High-end fashion runways are not only a fashion event but an artshow, displaying unique single pieces that have been created as a work of art.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.4.3.4. Con: Designer products are not neceressarily of high quality. Especially in the clothing industry it is no secret, that many designer clothings brands \(Giorgio Armani, Ralph Lauren, Michael Kors, etc.\) get their products produced in cheap factories in Bangladesh [as well](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323998604578567522527553976).
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.4.3.4.1. Con: The cheap factories in Bangladesh do not necessarily produce everything in low quality. The designer t-shirts e.g. have prints of higher quality and a high-quality contrast piping.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.4.3.4.1.1. Pro: Garment workers start at an early age with training on the job, e.g. with [10 years](http://www.waronwant.org/media/sweatshop-worker-tells-her-story). This makes them highly skilled in their task.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.4.3.4.1.1.1. Con: Child labour is considered exploitative and cannot serve as a reason for skilled tasks. Child labour is not compatible with the principles of high quality.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.4.3.4.1.1.1.1. Con: If it is morally appreciated or not does not matter for the development of skills. Children are much [quicker](http://www.writefix.com/?page_id=1875) in learning things.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.4.3.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: In manufacturing producers measure the degree to which a product was produced correctly. Support personnel measure the [quality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_%28business%29) in the degree that a product is reliable, maintainable, or sustainable. Child labour does not fit the criteria.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.4.3.4.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Mainly consumers are concerned with performance, features, reliability, conformance, durability, serviceability, aesthetics and safety when [assessing](http://www.prenhall.com/divisions/bp/app/russellcd/PROTECT/CHAPTERS/CHAP03/HEAD01.HTM) the quality of a product. The quality of production is only marginal for this assessment.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.4.3.4.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Satisfaction of high-end consumers' concerns and standards is of concern to the producers of high quality products. Thus the quality of production does play a role.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.4.3.4.1.1.2. Con: Most of the garment workers did not gain training. As a result the products produced are of [inferior](http://textilelearner.blogspot.kr/2013/04/life-of-garment-workers-in-bangladesh.html) quality.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.4.3.4.1.1.2.1. Con: In manual labor learning by doing is often the best training.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.4.3.4.1.1.3. Con: The lower [life expectancy](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#;example=75;) in Bangladesh means that older workers will have less experience even though they started at a lower age.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.4.3.4.1.1.4. Pro: Learning something at an early age is very easy and makes for greater improvements than at a later stage.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.4.3.4.1.1.4.1. Pro: Learning is [harder](http://www.mempowered.com/aging/why-learning-harder-we-get-older) as we get older.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.4.3.4.1.2. Con: Clothing that is made in unhygienic work environments, such as in [Bangladeshi](http://www.waronwant.org/media/sweatshop-worker-tells-her-story) factories, is likely to make the product less hygienic.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.4.3.4.1.3. Pro: The high production volume is supposed to lead to a higher degree in quality as workers gain skills.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.4.3.4.2. Con: However, they use natural fabrics of better quality such as pure cotton, wool or silk compared to cheap retailers mostly using synthetic fibers.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.4.3.4.3. Con: Shoe manufacturers like Diadora, New Balance or Kangaroos \(partially even Nike\) produce their "Designer-lines" \(often collaborations with designers\) in Europe and the US, because they focus very heavily on quality for those lines.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.5. Pro: Luxury items very often have high resell value, thus buying those can be seen as an investment.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.5.1. Pro: Unworn clothing of all styles \(from a hat to a sneaker\) very often rise in value after their release.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.5.2. Pro: Oldtimers are pretty valuable.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.3.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.2.2.1.1.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.4. Con: It is not luxury goods that led to an increasing amount of decadence and pretentiousness, but the opposite: the mass production and consumption of cheap products of inferior quality such as "fast fashion".
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.4.1. Pro: Ignoring human and ecological tragedies in producing countries like Bangladesh is not only inhumane, but also decadent.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.4.1.1. Con: Also luxury goods are produced in countries such as Bangladesh. So the allegation of decadence affects them as well.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.4.2. Pro: There even is a term for the rise of textile waste referring to the most notorious clothing retailer: the [Primark effect](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1089094/The-Primark-effect-Throwaway-fashion-recycled-makes-30-cent-waste-council-tips.html).
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.4.3. Pro: The number of clothing items bought per person per year rises constantly.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.4.3.1. Pro: Fashion became more globalised - and therefore cheaper - in the late 1990s.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.4.3.1.1. Con: [Fashion](http://www.statista.com/statistics/275318/womens-clothing-prices-cities/) [prices](http://www.statista.com/statistics/275331/mens-clothing-prices-cities/) and expenditure varies greatly with location indicating that globalization has only a minor effect on final prices.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.4.3.1.2. Pro: Because of falling prices retailers who did not yet produce overseas decided to work with factories in [countries](https://books.google.de/books?id=ETXhAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA14&lpg=PA14&dq=fashion+prices+1990s&source=bl&ots=wXv4YuWhqR&sig=EJiUg6FXB52jjGm2gI8JYue-siw&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjIvePzjv_KAhVFGZoKHZpdAVIQ6AEIZTAL#v=onepage&q=fashion%20prices%201990s&f=false) with lower production costs.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.4.3.1.3. Pro: The EU lost significant market share of [clothing exports](https://books.google.de/books?id=ETXhAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA14&lpg=PA14&dq=fashion+prices+1990s&source=bl&ots=wXv4YuWhqR&sig=EJiUg6FXB52jjGm2gI8JYue-siw&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjIvePzjv_KAhVFGZoKHZpdAVIQ6AEIZTAL#v=onepage&q=fashion%20prices%201990s&f=false).
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.4.3.1.4. Pro: A pair of shoes became [36% cheaper](https://books.google.de/books?id=ETXhAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA14&lpg=PA14&dq=fashion+prices+1990s&source=bl&ots=wXv4YuWhqR&sig=EJiUg6FXB52jjGm2gI8JYue-siw&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjIvePzjv_KAhVFGZoKHZpdAVIQ6AEIZTAL#v=onepage&q=fashion%20prices%201990s&f=false) between 1988 and 2004.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.4.3.1.5. Pro: After the formation of the EU in 1990 the market became quickly integrated and allowed for fiercer competition among producers.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.4.3.1.5.1. Pro: Zara was able to supply quickly from Spain to Britain when it [expanded](https://books.google.de/books?id=ETXhAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA14&lpg=PA14&dq=fashion+prices+1990s&source=bl&ots=wXv4YuWhqR&sig=EJiUg6FXB52jjGm2gI8JYue-siw&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjIvePzjv_KAhVFGZoKHZpdAVIQ6AEIZTAL#v=onepage&q=fashion%20prices%201990s&f=false) there in the late 1990s.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.4.3.2. Pro: People increasingly realize, that they can express themselves through what they wear, because that "privilege" is not limited anymore to those who can afford it.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.4.3.3. Pro: One goal of having "a sneaker for each day of the year" is a pretty often heard "goal/achievement" in Sneakerhead circles.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.4.3.4. Pro: In 1997, the average woman in the UK bought 19 items of clothing per year, by 2007 that number was up to 34. \([faircompanies.com](http://faircompanies.com/news/view/fashion-guide-i-slow-fashion/)\)
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.4.4. Pro: These products are bought just to be thrown away a short while later.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.4.4.1. Con: Many people actually wear those products and do not just throw them away.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.4.4.2. Pro: Cheap retailer clothings are often of bad quality \(loosening of seems, shrinking after laundry, fading colours, etc.\).
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.4.4.3. Pro: Many cheap retailers such as H&M have gone from producing four collections a year \(classic seasons\) to producing multiple collections for every occasion \(even Christmas, NYE, Valentine's Day, etc.\). This encourages consumers to buy more and more.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.5. Con: The popularity of [grunge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grunge) and alternative rock led to a non-decadent lifestyle among young people in the 1990s.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.6. Con: The definition of luxury goods is way too subjective to apply them to the whole of the discussed group \(Europeans\).
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.9. Pro: Mass produced goods and the consumption of cheap products such as "[fast fashion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_fashion)" was order of business.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.4.2.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.4.3.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.9.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.3.1.4.1.8.4.4.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.10. Pro: Tons of perfectly fine food were thrown away every year because of overproduction.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.10.1. Pro: Households in the [UK](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7370218) are not only wasting food by dumping it but also by feeding edible food to pets.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.11. Con: In the times of today, the way of how and what we consume became a factor of distinguishing oneself from others, thus consumption being a very advanced form of expressing oneself. This is not reckless.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.11.1. Con: Self expression through consumption becomes reckless once it destroys the foundation of life for others.
1.1.7.3.1.4.1.11.2. Pro: [Self-expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs) \(Self-actualization\) is the highest need of the individual in societies which focus on the individual, as it is the case in Europe.
1.1.7.3.1.4.2. Pro: At the end of the 19th century [anomie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomie) was stronger than in the 1990s. Moral obligations were lower and thus reckless behavior was more acceptable.
1.1.7.3.1.4.2.1. Pro: Increased knowledge led to a better understanding of how human behavior contributes to global problems. This knowledge creates a moral obligation to act diligently.
1.1.7.3.1.4.2.2. Pro: In democracies the [anomie level](https://www.soc.umn.edu/~uggen/Zhao_SF_10.pdf) is lower, thus Europeans with successful democratization experience less anomie.
1.1.7.3.1.4.2.3. Con: Marriage is a [crucial determinant](https://www.soc.umn.edu/~uggen/Zhao_SF_10.pdf) of the level of anomie. Reduced rates of wed couples in the 20th century are, thus, increasing the level of anomie.
1.1.7.3.1.4.2.4. Con: Because the [confidence in authorities](https://www.soc.umn.edu/~uggen/Zhao_SF_10.pdf) is lower in the 1990s the level of anomie is higher.
1.1.7.3.1.4.3. Pro: The range of those for whom we [feel empathy](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=J7ATQb6LZX0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=better+angles+of+our+nature&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false) and who we [meet with altruism](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=Yve7lgvtLcsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=expanding+circle&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=expanding%20circle&f=false) has extended beyond the family to nation and race, and ultimately to mankind and society as a whole.
1.1.7.3.1.4.3.1. Con: Hate towards others persist perhaps best seen in [hate crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_crime).
1.1.7.3.1.4.3.2. Con: Altruism is declining in society.
1.1.7.3.1.4.3.2.1. Pro: Measured by [blood](http://www.bmj.com/content/317/7170/1405.1) or [organ](http://www.livescience.com/35844-organ-donation-shortage-study.html) donations, altruism is declining.
1.1.7.3.1.4.3.2.2. Pro: Young people [volunteer](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/nvsm.89/abstract) less often in British society.
1.1.7.3.1.4.3.2.3. Pro: [Voting](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=L41MCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT37&lpg=PT37&dq=decline+in+altruism&source=bl&ots=HIQ1rzDk2Q&sig=-XmTGsHjbm1yZDeMzrVW8VJdjYw&hl=ko&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjXqsiC5JvMAhWSq5QKHZQxB7oQ6AEIQzAE#v=onepage&q&f=false) can be regarded as altruistic act and thus decline in turnout signifies reduced altruism.
1.1.7.3.1.4.3.2.4. Pro: As the population's share living in cities increases, so does altruistic behavior decrease: Stanley Milgram's thesis of ["urban overload"](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=XA8Ho_aITVoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Crowding+and+Behavior&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj12IbApprMAhVW2WMKHZepBAoQ6AEIHzAB#v=onepage&q=Crowding%20and%20Behavior&f=false).
1.1.7.3.1.4.4. Con: -> See 1.1.7.3.1.4.3.2.4.
1.1.7.3.1.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.2.
1.1.7.3.1.4.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.3.1.3.4.
1.1.7.3.1.4.7. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.
1.1.7.3.1.4.8. Con: Although it is true that welfare took better care of the weak, categories such as "nice", "civilized" and/or "considerate" are so incredibly subjective and culture-specific \(and mind you - Europe is culturally very diverse\), that they simply cannot be used to paint a broad picture of the "quality of life" of the people of the continent.
1.1.7.3.1.5. Pro: The threat of war was less in the 1990s than in the 1890s.
1.1.7.3.1.5.1. Pro: Since WW2 there have not been any wars between European countries.
1.1.7.3.1.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.8.1.
1.1.7.3.1.5.2. Con: While in the 1890s there was only one war between Greece and the Osman Empire fought on European soil, there were numerous wars on the Balkans in the 1990s. Thus military conflict was more likely to happen and "closer" to "core Europe".
1.1.7.3.1.5.2.1. Con: Greece is at least as close to 'core' Europe as the Balkans. They were in the EU earlier.
1.1.7.3.1.5.3. Pro: In the 1990s Europeans were celebrating the end of the Cold War and the stop of the Soviet menace.
1.1.7.3.1.5.3.1. Pro: A feeling of ideological superiority and security to be always on the safe side emerged in the post-Cold War world.
1.1.7.3.1.5.3.1.1. Pro: Francis Fukuyama's [essay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_History_and_the_Last_Man) about the end of history conveyed a feeling that the final endpoint of stable government has been reached.
1.1.7.3.1.5.3.1.2. Pro: The US was seen to create a [new world order](http://www.economist.com/node/1188839) without an opponent.
1.1.7.3.1.5.3.2. Con: Individuals had less trust in institutions and a new individualism emerged. After the [Cold War](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=TaNjBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA150&lpg=PA150&dq=end+of+cold+war+celebrations&source=bl&ots=1VTV6JHQ7K&sig=rDWhqgsQ7zrmlzNF6g9w-M8uIQ4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiA_NGxif7KAhVBv5QKHd2jANsQ6AEINDAF#v=onepage&q&f=false) it was perceived in movies that everyone has to fight for her/himself.
1.1.7.3.1.5.3.3. Pro: Movies in the [immediate postwar era](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=TaNjBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA150&lpg=PA150&dq=end+of+cold+war+celebrations&source=bl&ots=1VTV6JHQ7K&sig=rDWhqgsQ7zrmlzNF6g9w-M8uIQ4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiA_NGxif7KAhVBv5QKHd2jANsQ6AEINDAF#v=onepage&q&f=false) were not centered on the threat of nuclear annihilation anymore. This made people feel safer.
1.1.7.3.1.5.3.4. Pro: On the newly founded [Love Parade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Parade), a dance music festival and demonstration for international understanding through love and music in Berlin, people were celebrating peace and disembarrassment after cold war.
1.1.7.3.1.6. Con: People are happy in the systems they grow up. Even North Koreans think they are [normal](http://www.ncnk.org/resources/publications/Kang%20They%20Think%20Theyre%20Normal.pdf). Thus the likelihood is high that there would not be a change and people of the 1890s would be happy about their times.
1.1.7.3.1.6.1. Con: By this logic, no political evolution would ever take place as no dissatisfaction and desire for change would occur. And North Korea would not have to prevent its citizens from leaving by force.
1.1.7.3.1.6.1.1. Con: This might very well be the case in most political systems.
1.1.7.3.1.6.1.2. Con: It is mostly [poor regions](http://blog.donga.com/nambukstory/archives/111949) in the North of North Korea, such as Ryanggang, or North Hamgyong, from where refugees escape. This means they escape for lack of basic needs, such as food, rather than political dissatisfaction.
1.1.7.3.1.6.1.2.1. Pro: Since the great famine of the 1990s the number of defectors increased. This suggests that hunger is a major motivation.
1.1.7.3.1.6.1.2.2. Pro: Yanggang, or North Hamgyong are the North Korean provinces with the [highest mortality](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=6kFVdjkcXZYC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=defectors&f=false).
1.1.7.3.1.7. Con: People have a social network around them and thus they would not trade one time against the other for fear of loosing it.
1.1.7.3.1.8. Con: People are used to their life and the state of technology. Jumping 100 years forward in time would make it impossible for them to settle in society.
1.1.7.3.1.8.1. Con: Rawl's original position does not presume that people would have to be relocated. It is rather a thought experiment that assumes no existence of a prior society \(or position\).
1.1.7.3.1.8.1.1. Con: A thought experiment that does not take into account real problems is unlikely to be correct.
1.1.7.3.2. Con: During the 1990s, about half the citizens in a number of countries stated [in opinion surveys](https://web.stanford.edu/~ldiamond/papers/howPeopleViewDem.pdf) that democracy is not necessarily always the preferred system of government. Among those countries were Taiwan, South Korea, Chile and Brazil.
1.1.8. Con: In Victorian England the development of political parties as we know them today was completed by the 1870s.
1.1.8.1. Pro: The '[efficient secret](http://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/politics-international-relations/british-government-politics-and-policy/efficient-secret-cabinet-and-development-political-parties-victorian-england)' of UK politics with a Cabinet with not only executive but also legislative predominance developed in the 19th century.
1.1.8.2. Pro: The strong [intra-party cohesion](https://archive.org/details/influencepartyl00lowegoog) that makes the UK's system go round saw its formation in the late 19th century.
1.1.8.3. Pro: Through the three [Reform Acts](http://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/politics-international-relations/british-government-politics-and-policy/efficient-secret-cabinet-and-development-political-parties-victorian-england) British politics transformed from an aristocratic to a democratic and party-based politics in the 19th century.
1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.7.3.1.1.3.4.1.
1.3. Con: In the 1990s people were much easier to influence than in 1890s, due to the large reach of media such as the radio or the television.
1.3.1. Con: People became more educated and savvy about how media influenced them.
1.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.3.1.2.
1.3.2. Pro: The media played a major role in shaping social realities after 1945. This indicates how strong it can influence people's lives.
1.3.2.1. Pro: The role of [women](http://ejc.sagepub.com/content/7/4/453.abstract) in the Netherlands was shaped by media in the late 20th century.
1.3.2.2. Pro: The European discourse towards [nuclear energy](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2780405?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) was shaped by the media.
1.3.2.3. Pro: The long term effects of [television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultivation_theory) made people live a life as they see it on TV.
1.3.2.3.1. Con: The same argument about cultivation has been made for the readers of [newspapers](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/jmp/22/4/147/), which were available in the 1890s.
1.3.3. Con: More media reduces [selective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_exposure_theory) media exposure because children can easier learn from other sources than their parents.
1.3.4. Pro: The exposure to new media, particularly video games, TV, and movies, had increased the rate of [violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_violence_research).
1.3.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.1.2.
1.3.4.2. Pro: Violence as a form of entertainment has made people more reckless to the use of guns and weapons. People also become desensitized to the sight of blood.
1.3.5. Pro: News were better able to set the [agenda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenda-setting_theory#Agenda_setting_between_media_and_other_sources) in the 1990s because it had become faster and connected with each other quicker.
1.3.6. Con: There were advertisements in the 1890s as well.
1.3.6.1. Pro: [Thomas J. Baratt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising#20th_century) from London is counted as "father" of modern advertisement. He started his campaign for Pears soap in the 19th century.
1.3.6.2. Pro: Already in the 1850s advertisement was [described](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=5B4A4dgn4rAC&pg=PA19&dq=Commodity+Culture+in+Dickens%27s+Household+Words:+The+Social+Life+of+Good&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjM7OOhqJrMAhUUUGMKHUmRAnQQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&q=Commodity%20Culture%20in%20Dickens's%20Household%20Words%3A%20The%20Social%20Life%20of%20Good&f=false) as omnipresent and menacing.

1.7.1.2.2.3. Pro: Famous novels of the 1890s were reproduced in the 1990s and live on as forms of entertainment indicating their high level of entertainment.
1.7.1.2.2.3.1. Con: Many famous novels, such as [Haruki Murakami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruki_Murakami)'s works, were not there in the 1890s.
1.7.1.2.2.3.2. Pro: The novel [Around the World in 80 Days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Around_the_World_in_Eighty_Days#Film) was first published in 1873 but reproduced in the 1990s.
1.7.1.2.2.4. Con: In the 1890s consumer [expenditure](http://www.lse.ac.uk/economicHistory/pdf/wp102.pdf) for entertainment was relatively small.
1.7.1.2.2.5. Con: -> See 1.7.1.2.2.2.1.3.
1.7.1.2.2.6. Con: The introduction of "natural color" was a great development, which meant color that was photographically recorded from nature rather than added to black-and-white prints by hand-coloring, stencil-coloring or other arbitrary procedures.
1.7.1.2.2.7. Con: In the 1920s, the development of electronic sound recording technologies made it practical to incorporate a soundtrack of speech, music and sound effects synchronized with the action on the screen.
1.7.1.2.3. Con: Through standardization differences in individuals' entertainment knowledge reduces and makes entertainment less diverse in 1990 than in 1890.
1.7.1.2.3.1. Pro: Regional story-telling and local card games, or the personal stories of grandparents disappeared increasingly by the 1990.
1.7.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: Regional languages die with media integration and so do local stories disappear.
1.7.1.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.4.1.1.5.1.
1.7.1.2.3.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.4.1.1.5.2.
1.7.1.2.3.1.2. Pro: Families are increasingly affected by political events in the same way while in the past every family was able to tell an own story.
1.7.1.2.3.2. Con: Diversification of knowledge about the entertainment was guaranteed during the 1990s by an oversupply of entertainment.
1.7.1.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.2.2.1.1.
1.7.1.3. Con: Artists have become global icons that make them more distant, expensive and exclusive.
1.7.1.4. Con: A special feature of art is its appreciation. With mass production this appreciation vanishes and art renders itself an object of quotidian life.
1.7.2. Con: Modern technology allows for profound art forms, as can be found in the projects of [Dan Flavin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Flavin).
1.7.3. Pro: Modern art works are often not distinguishable from the real items and thus added nothing anymore to arts and culture of the 1890s.
1.7.3.1. Pro: Warhol's [Brillo Box](http://www.warhol.org/education/resourceslessons/Aesthetics--Arthur-Danto/) could not be distinguished from a real box if it would be next to it.
1.7.3.2. Pro: Dan Flavin's [neon lights](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/300263500129669377/) are indistinguishable from New York subway lights.
1.7.3.3. Pro: Marcel [Duchamp](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/duchamp-fountain-t07573) exhibited a urinal as an artwork.
1.7.3.4. Con: Modern art forms, such as [Dada](http://www.theartstory.org/movement-dada.htm), make a point out of stretching the boundaries of what we consider art and producing "anti-art", for example by utilizing mundane objects. They intent to call into question what art is, and what purpose it serves for society. It intends to provoke [critical engagement with art](http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1262&context=dadasur); its achievement is visible in the very discussion we are having here.
1.7.3.4.1. Con: The Dada movement had ended by the 1990s.
1.7.3.4.1.1. Con: Dadaism is still highly influential in exhibitions and art sales, as [the prices of works](https://news.artnet.com/market/artnet-newss-top-10-expensive-living-american-artists-2015-323871) by Dada-inspired artists like Warhol, Koons and Wool illustrate.
1.7.3.4.2. Con: Dada [artworks](http://www.theartstory.org/movement-dada-artworks.htm#pnt_2) were generally distinguishable from normal products.
1.7.4. Pro: Many modern pieces of art are not easy to see as art and therefore need some institutional [framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_art#Institutional) to be declared and recognized as such, e.g. in a museum. This means art in itself becomes irrelevant without a frame.
1.7.4.1. Con: Movements like [street art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_art) that took art out of that framework were established in the 1980s.
1.7.4.1.1. Con: Not every graffiti becomes street art. Only through the recognition of the art after artists like Banksy some paintings had the possibility to transform into art.
1.7.4.1.1.1. Pro: Graffiti can be considered [vandalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandalism).
1.7.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: Banksy himself was hiding from the [police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banksy#Early_career_.281992.E2.80.932001.29).
1.7.4.1.1.2. Con: Graffiti was considered a form of art long before Banksy.
1.7.4.1.1.3. Con: Graffiti becomes street art through its existence. The recognition as art does not depend on per- or reception by other artists but, as with every art, by the individual himself.
1.7.4.1.1.3.1. Con: Graffiti is not street art. Graffiti is an unique sub-cultural movement, that can at best seen as a kind of prototype of street art, but it has way more rules and internal rule sets than street art in particular or art in general has.
1.7.4.1.1.3.1.1. Con: One of the people changing those rulesets of graffiti culture was Shepard Fairey, better known as Obey, who started the transformation with his [Andre the Giant has a posse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_the_Giant_Has_a_Posse) campaign.
1.7.4.1.1.3.1.2. Con: Graffiti and Street Art are very close and belong together, together they can be subsumed as Urban Art, which shows in the emergence of Art fairs such as the [Urban Art Fair](http://urbanartfair.fr/en/) in Paris or the [Stroke Artfair](http://www.stroke-artfair.com/) in Munich/Berlin.
1.7.4.1.1.3.1.3. Con: Graffiti and Street Art are shown as at least complementary in [one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Eck%C5%8D%27s_Getting_Up:_Contents_Under_Pressure) of the two video games on the topic which have to be taken serious.
1.7.4.1.1.4. Con: -> See 1.7.4.1.1.3.1.
1.7.4.1.2. Con: Most graffitis are not standing alone but their ensemble is considered as art work, such as the East Side Gallery. Thus, the individual piece is no art.
1.7.4.1.2.1. Con: Artists like [Banksy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banksy) create pieces that do not need an ensemble.
1.7.4.1.2.2. Con: Due to the lack of allowed spaces and the history of Graffiti \(which is embraced by those who just keep it in illegal spaces\) what we see as "ensembles" with greater context in reality is just called a "Hall of Fame" where local graffiti artists have legal spaces to write on walls. But there is no overarching theme or concept in general, just the assembly of individual pieces.
1.7.4.1.2.2.1. Con: This does not apply to the example of the East Side Gallery in Berlin, which is an ensemble and was designed as such.
1.7.4.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: The East Side Gallery is one of the most influential graffiti art exhibitions in the world.
1.7.4.2. Pro: The success of art does not rely on its aesthetic qualities anymore, but first and foremost on endorsement by the art world: ["Without institutional support the artist is doomed and art becomes non sequitur](https://books.google.co.kr/books/about/The_Key_Issues_Concerning_Contemporary_A.html?id=68Ia-Al0RRIC&redir_esc=y)".
1.7.4.3. Con: The vast majority of art consumed in 1990 was consumer art - movies, comics, video games - that is accessible via the open market and not in need of any institutional framework.
1.7.4.3.1. Pro: "Art itself" adopts very fast to new technologies and finds its way to the audience.
1.7.5. Pro: There is no more [progress](http://hyperallergic.com/191329/an-illustrated-guide-to-arthur-dantos-the-end-of-art/) in art as it has disintegrated into a cluster of competing approaches and understandings of what 'art' means.
1.7.5.1. Con: -> See 1.7.3.4.
1.7.6. Pro: TV was an major cultural asset, entertaining people on a broad but rather shallow level.
1.7.6.1. Pro: Watching TV reduces the time to read [books](https://www.dcmp.org/caai/nadh175.pdf).
1.7.6.1.1. Pro: The brain could be said to be in an hypnotical situation when watching tv, causing it more relaxing to do as an activity in comparison with the activity of reading, which requires an higher level of concentration
1.7.6.2. Pro: The spread of TV [accelerated](http://www.barb.co.uk/resources/tv-facts/tv-ownership) between 1950s and 1990s. This added TV as a qualitative asset for entertainment.
1.7.6.2.1. Con: TV [addiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_addiction) prevents individuals from partaking in social life and makes them feel less happy.
1.7.6.2.1.1. Con: Individuals that feel socially isolated can make use of TV to stay connected with society by creating [imaginary friends](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/imaginary-friends/).
1.7.6.2.1.1.1. Con: Imaginary friends do not help to stay connected with society but rather deepen social exclusion as they reduce the pressure to connect with others in real life.
1.7.6.2.1.2. Pro: TV consumption is comparable to [hypnosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_aspects_of_television#Psychological_effects) because it only encourages activity on the right side of the brain.
1.7.6.2.1.3. Con: TV programmes can be beneficial to social life, e.g. in times of huge sports events like the upcoming UEFA European Championship.
1.7.6.2.2. Con: Watching TV makes people more [aggressive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_aspects_of_television#Alleged_dangers).
1.7.6.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.6.2.1.3.
1.7.6.2.4. Pro: People who are watching TV do not need to leave their house to be entertained if they do not want to.
1.7.6.2.5. Con: TV consumption makes dull because the brain creates [dopamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_aspects_of_television#Psychological_effects).
1.7.6.2.6. Con: TV creates blurred imaginations about reality.
1.7.6.2.6.1. Pro: TV consumption is influencing [work](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1559-1816.2008.00436.x/full) behavior and expectations.
1.7.6.2.6.2. Pro: [Casting](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DawsonCasting) of young adults in their mid-20s for teenage roles creates unrealistic imaginations about the appearance of teenagers.
1.7.6.2.6.3. Pro: TV created [images](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic) of items, landscapes, skills and behaviors that do not resemble reality, e.g. White Christmas or that the heart is so far on the left.
1.7.6.2.6.4. Pro: [Reality TV](http://www.parents-choice.org/article.cfm?art_id=313&the_page=editorials) creates an image of 'reality' that is unrealistic and emphasizes competitiveness, immature behavior and distorted reward systems.
1.7.6.2.6.5. Pro: [Dating](http://www.bustle.com/articles/119286-90s-sitcom-dating-vs-real-life-will-make-that-decades-tv-seem-so-unrealistic) expectations of the 1990s were shaped by sitcoms.
1.7.6.2.7. Pro: TV is helping [education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_television) of citizens and therewith increase their life quality.
1.7.6.2.7.1. Pro: Because TV is a very [accessible](https://www.dcmp.org/caai/nadh175.pdf) medium, it reaches learners that have not been able to participate in traditional adult literacy programs.
1.7.6.2.7.2. Pro: Even though it might not increase mental well-being, education does prevent mental [illness](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/education_may_not/).
1.7.6.2.7.3. Con: -> See 1.7.6.1.
1.7.6.2.7.4. Pro: Educational TV [programs](https://www.dcmp.org/caai/nadh175.pdf) help adults and children to develop their skills in a convenient way.
1.7.6.2.8. Pro: Of the top 20 TV programmes screened in the UK in 1990, there were [19](http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/downloads/bfi-the-stats-an-overview-of-the-film-television-video-and-dvd-industries-in-the-uk-1990-2003.pdf) entertainment programs.
1.7.6.3. Con: -> See 1.7.6.2.7.
1.7.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.7.6.2.5.
1.7.7. Con: There was still more than enough "serious" arts and culture in Europe in the 1990s. Just because there is simple entertainment now, does not mean that art and culture is gone.
1.7.7.1. Pro: Modern art forms emerged in the 20th century.
1.7.7.1.1. Pro: [Minimalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism) is a distinct form of art and made contribution to the city spaces and [living environment](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/interiors/11539508/A-Parisian-architect-does-liveable-minimalism.html) of the people of Europe.
1.7.7.2. Con: The art forms that sprung in the early 20th century, like surrealism or dadaism, emerged out of the proto-avantgarde movement at the turn of the century. There is no comparable thing for the late 20th century.
1.7.7.2.1. Pro: [Marinetti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filippo_Tommaso_Marinetti) is one of the founding fathers of modern European art forms and was most active in the early 1900s.
1.7.7.3. Pro: The richness of city architecture is bigger today than it was in the 19th century given the different styles that integrate with each other.
1.7.7.4. Pro: European cities spend billions every year on museums, theatres and philharmonic orchestras, many of them easily among the best in the world in their department.
1.7.8. Con: New forms of arts and culture were, in the beginning, very often seen as profane and simple entertainment regardless of their qualities. This was the case with Jazz, Rock and Roll, or Pop. Thus, it seems to be a defensive stance rather than a qualitative measure.
1.7.8.1. Pro: "Seriousness" lies in the eye of the beholder. Songs by musicians like David Bowie or Bob Dylan were seen as total scrap by fans of classical music.
1.7.8.2. Pro: Art forms expand building upon each other, making new developments appear to be of low quality. From hindsight, however, we can see that they were crucial building blocks in the [formation of modern art](http://makezine.com/2013/11/15/art-technology-new-art-forms-not-just-new-art/).
1.8. Con: Europe was at the climax of its power with its colonial empire at the end of the 19th century. Spillover effects from this position of power benefited citizens in their daily lives and decreased since then.
1.8.1. Con: By 1890 the United States had [overtaken all European powers](https://books.google.co.kr/books/about/Power_Transitions_Strategies_For_the_21s.html?id=xEF3AAAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y), Russia as well as China in terms of economic output and international power.
1.8.1.1. Con: The capabilities of the US did not transform into power because the [institutional](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/6306.html) set-up prevented an extraction of resources for foreign policy conduct.
1.8.1.2. Con: In the 1890s the US themselves thought to lack behind the race for imperialism and battleships.
1.8.2. Pro: In the 1890s it was a time of great technological advancement that changed the life of people. The technology of the 1990s is nothing in comparison.
1.8.2.1. Con: The so called third great wave of inventions, [the digital revolution](http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21621156-first-two-industrial-revolutions-inflicted-plenty-pain-ultimately-benefited), took place in late 20th century and changed people's life strongly and significantly.
1.8.2.1.1. Pro: [New technologies](http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21621156-first-two-industrial-revolutions-inflicted-plenty-pain-ultimately-benefited), like the omnipresent internet, advanced robotics and machine intelligence were developed.
1.8.2.1.1.1. Con: Many new technologies could not show their full potential during the 1990s and would need more time to develop.
1.8.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Until the year 2000 only about [4%](http://www.internetworldstats.com/emarketing.htm) of the world population used the internet.
1.8.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: If these 4% are concentrated in Europe and the US then this is sufficient to have a thriving internet industry.
1.8.2.2. Pro: There is [no comparable innovation](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2016-02-15/innovation-over) that revolutionized individual life's as did the inventions at the end of the 19th century.
1.8.2.2.1. Pro: The steam engine, the locomotive, the telephone, the telegraph, the internal combustion engine, electrical light - all these inventions came out of the 19th century and laid the foundation for the unprecedented growth of the 20th century.
1.8.2.2.2. Con: [Productivity](http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/CetteEtal09.pdf) grew at a faster pace between 1950 and 1980 than it did between 1890 and 1950. This indicates that the major contributions and innovations took place in the second half of the 20th century.
1.8.3. Pro: Colonies have provided material benefits to the citizens of Europe.
1.8.3.1. Pro: For the UK the opium trade between its colony India and China was of major importance and channeled much silver to Westminster.
1.8.3.1.1. Con: During the period of New Imperialism - which the 1890s are part of - colonies had generally become unprofitable for colonial powers and a burden on their tax payers \(see [here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0335.00092/abstract) and [here](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=94e1PxsJrOoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mammon+and+the+Pursuit+of+Empire&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=unprofitable&f=false)\).
1.8.3.2. Pro: Between 1830 and 1870, 1 billion guilders were taken from [Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_Indies#Economic_history), on average making 25 per cent of the annual Dutch Government budget.
1.8.3.3. Con: Products produced in former colonies are still available.
1.8.3.4. Con: Cheap labor from migrant workers is still available.
1.8.4. Pro: Europeans enjoyed a feeling of superiority towards the rest of the world.
1.8.4.1. Pro: White men were treated like masters in the colonies.
1.8.4.2. Pro: Europeans saw themselves at the top of the hierarchy of civilizations, lived with a notion "[racial, cultural, scientific and technological superiority](http://ieg-ego.eu/en/threads/backgrounds/european-encounters/guido-abbattista-european-encounters-in-the-age-of-expansion)", and saw it as their mission to civilize other peoples.
1.8.4.3. Con: For European women this reduced feeling of cultural supremacy has created benefits because their role model changed.
1.8.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.2.1.
1.8.4.3.2. Pro: Women do less [housework](http://www.soc.umn.edu/~elkelly/Bianchietal2000HouseworkTrends.pdf) while men do more.
1.8.4.3.3. Con: Women have lost equally a status they once enjoyed as [role models](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=JgZ2_QFbEmMC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false) for women in colonized societies.
1.8.5. Con: It was in the Spanish-American war in 1898 that a European power was the first time defeated by a non-European power since industrial modernization.
1.8.5.1. Con: The US was seen as kind of European power. The first shock for Europeans was the defeat of Russia against Japan in 1905.
1.8.5.2. Pro: The [decline of the Spanish Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish%E2%80%93American_War) was a shock to the Spaniards and their understanding of superiority.
1.9. Con: The world for Europeans was safer in the 1890s than it was in the 1990s.
1.9.1. Pro: In the 1890s, Europeans were able to enjoy considerable [extraterritoriality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterritoriality#East_Asia) rights which made it safer for them if they committed a crime in another country outside Europe.
1.9.1.1. Con: Extraterritoriality was enjoyed by a small fraction of Europeans only.
1.9.2. Con: Improved communication and transportation systems made life safer as rescue teams and police are easier to contact and can better coordinate among themselves. This eventually saves lives.
1.9.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.3.1.1.10.
1.9.4. Pro: Terrorism had emerged by 1990s, spreading a feeling of insecurity that did not exist in 1890.
1.9.4.1. Pro: Technological developments made terrorism more threatening.
1.9.4.1.1. Pro: With technological developments in explosives it became easier to inflict mass casualties.
1.9.4.1.1.1. Pro: The increased availability of chemicals has allowed the construction of [improvised explosive devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvised_explosive_device).
1.9.4.1.1.2. Pro: [Dynamite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamite) was only invented in the second half of the 19th century and spread afterwards.
1.9.4.1.1.3. Pro: [C-4 explosive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-4_%28explosive%29) was just invented in 1956.
1.9.4.1.1.4. Pro: [PENT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentaerythritol_tetranitrate#Terrorist_use) was used in terrorist attacks since 1983.
1.9.4.1.2. Pro: More effective firearms made terrorism quicker, less detectable, and more devastating.
1.9.4.1.2.1. Pro: Early [gatling guns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_gun#Early_rapid-firing_weapons) had the size of contemporary artillery but developed into portable machine guns in the 20th century.
1.9.4.1.2.2. Pro: The first [semi-automatic firearms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-automatic_firearm) were developed in the early 20th century giving terrorist easier access to cheap and effective firearms.
1.9.4.1.2.3. Con: The [revolver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolver) was already widespread in the 19th century.
1.9.4.1.2.4. Pro: In the 19th century [single-shot firearms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-shot#History) were mostly used only. This makes terrorist attacks back then slower and less devastating.
1.9.4.1.3. Pro: With better media coverage terrorist attacks became threatening to Europeans even if they are not committed on European soil.
1.9.4.1.3.1. Con: Attacks on Europeans in colonies were seen as threatening by 19th century Europeans.
1.9.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: When Opium traders in early 19th century China were attacked by anti-foreign mobs, businesses in the [UK](http://books.wwnorton.com/books/Commissioner-Lin-and-the-Opium-War/) felt threatened and pressured for military intervention.
1.9.4.1.3.2. Pro: After the [Oklahoma City bombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_bombing#International_reaction) in 1995 Europeans were shocked and indicated sympathy with the victims.
1.9.4.1.3.3. Pro: The 1993 [World Trade Centre Bombing](https://www.stratfor.com/weekly/look-back-1993-world-trade-center-bombing) was broadcasted in Europe spreading a sense of insecurity.
1.9.4.1.3.4. Pro: [Fictional popular culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelignite#Use_in_popular_culture) of terrorist attacks spread a feeling of insecurity regardless of whether these were commited in reality.
1.9.4.2. Pro: The intensity of terrorism increased and made it more threatening.
1.9.4.2.1. Pro: In the 1990s the first signs of  [Islamic terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_terrorism#Late_20th_century) started to threaten the population.
1.9.4.2.2. Pro: The emergence of widespread indiscriminate [terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_terrorism#Early_20th_century) is bound to the emergence of revolutionary nationalism in the 20th century.
1.9.4.3. Pro: By the 1990s there had already emerged a new form of terrorism \(mostly due to globalization\): international terrorism.
1.9.4.3.1. Pro: "New" forms of terrorism are very often driven by religion, thus nationality by logic has to play a smaller role.
1.9.4.3.1.1. Pro: In contrast, terrorism in the 19th century was often motivated by [nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalist_terrorism), such as [Narodnaya Volya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narodnaya_Volya) or the [Black Hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hand_\(Serbia\)). Thus the motivation changed.
1.9.4.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.9.4.2.1.
1.9.4.3.2. Con: Europe did not experience many terror attacks in the 1990s.
1.9.4.3.2.1. Pro: There were only two attacks that targeted citizens in a nondiscriminatory way.
1.9.4.3.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.9.4.2.1.
1.9.4.3.2.1.2. Pro: The [1995 Paris Metro bombings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_Paris_M%C3%A9tro_and_RER_bombings) were targeting civilians.
1.9.4.3.2.1.3. Pro: The [1998 Omagh Bombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omagh_bombing) killed 39 random citizens.
1.9.4.4. Con: Terror was already widespread in Europe in 1890.
1.9.4.4.1. Pro: The first recorded act of terrorism in the civil society was the assassination of Jean Paul Marat by Charlotte Corday. The risk of terrorism therefore was already present almost 100 years in Europe before the 1890s.
1.9.4.4.1.1. Con: Jean Paul Marat's [assassination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Corday#Marat.27s_assassination) was done with a hidden blade which is a fundamental different method than bombing innocent people.
1.9.4.4.1.2. Pro: Assassinations of political opponents were quite normal in all of humanity's history.
1.9.4.4.2. Pro: In Germany, as a reaction to the terrorist murder of August von Kotzebue, the [Carlsbad Decrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlsbad_Decrees#Investigating_Committee) were introduced in 1819. They resembled anti-terror laws of today. Thus, terror did not seem to be a French phenomenon, even more that Germany by the time they were introduced had not experienced a revolution like France.
1.9.4.4.3. Con: Terror was targeted on politically agitating individuals in 1890 while it became nondiscriminatory in the 1990s.
1.9.4.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.4.3.2.1.2.
1.9.4.4.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.9.4.3.2.1.3.
1.9.4.4.3.3. Con: Terrorism got a new meaning in the times of civil society, having the focus not only on specific targets, but the aftermath on chosen societal spheres. Thus the nondiscriminatory factor does not matter, because for the targeted spheres, who are intended to be brought into upheaval, are still the same, regardless of who specifically got killed.
1.9.4.4.3.3.1. Con: When terrorists only kill political targets all non-political persons can feel safe. This is different if terrorists kill nondiscriminatory.
1.9.4.5. Con: -> See 1.9.4.3.2.
1.9.5. Pro: By 1990, the threat of nuclear annihilation had developed.
1.9.5.1. Con: Nuclear annihilation was [not a practical possibility or actual threat](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/waltz1.htm) due to the certainty of mutually assured destruction.
1.9.5.1.1. Con: Many people [feared](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/the-rise-of-nuclear-fear-how-we-learned-to-fear-the-bomb/) nuclear annihilation regardless of whether it was imagined or real.
1.9.5.1.2. Con: Nuclear wars can start by accident.
1.9.5.1.2.1. Pro: An accidentally nuclear detonation in a highly tensed situation can be misinterpreted and lead to war.
1.9.5.1.2.2. Pro: Nuclear equipped powers can be dragged into an initially smaller war and feel compelled to make use of nuclear weapons there.
1.9.5.1.3. Con: Mutually assured destruction is of no help to most Europeans who live in countries that do not have nuclear weapons.
1.9.5.1.3.1. Con: All Europeans live under the nuclear umbrella of NATO and the EU. Several large European countries - such as Germany and Italy - without their own nuclear weapons even have American nuclear weapons stationed on their territory.
1.9.5.1.3.1.1. Con: The EU does not provide security guarantees.
1.9.5.1.3.1.1.1. Con: In case of doubt there will be strong normative pressure to assist an attacked member state.
1.9.5.1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: When [France](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/paris-terror-eu-countries-pledge-military-support-as-france-and-russia-launch-new-air-strikes-on-a6738511.html) perceived to be under attack by ISIS terrorism EU states rushed to support it.
1.9.5.1.3.1.2. Con: Eastern European countries experience a fear of abandonment.
1.9.5.1.3.1.3. Con: Not all EU members are members of NATO.
1.9.5.1.3.1.4. Pro: The states of Western Europe  - among them two nuclear powers - were [part of the Western European Union](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=GsyhCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA305&dq=Historical+Dictionary+of+the+European+Union&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjR4MfhgZ_MAhWmnqYKHWR8AMkQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&q=%22Western%20European%20Union%22&f=false) from 1954 to 2010 which included a mutual defense clause.
1.9.5.1.4. Pro: Not a single nuclear weapon was deployed with aggressive intent since 1945. Even confrontations of great powers - such as the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Korean War - did not feature their use.
1.9.5.1.4.1. Con: The world came to nuclear annihilation several times.
1.9.5.1.4.1.1. Pro: Strategic [bombers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_bomber#The_Cold_War_and_its_aftermath) were constantly in the air to retaliate.
1.9.5.1.4.1.2. Pro: Nuclear weapons played a strategic role during the Korean War when it was transferred to [Guam](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/bomb/peopleevents/pandeAMEX58.html) to be deployed quickly.
1.9.5.2. Con: By the 1990s the Cold War was over and therefore the main source of nuclear annihilation, the UdSSR, had been defeated.
1.9.5.2.1. Con: While the Soviet Union had a tight grip on its nuclear materials, [a lack of security surrounding them](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=kcuJvl8FcBIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Transnational+Threats:+Smuggling+and+Trafficking+in+Arms,+Drugs,+and+Human+Life&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiL_r_455bMAhUlxqYKHVqvDAUQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&q&f=false) became a new, possibly even greater danger after the Soviet Union's demise.
1.9.5.2.1.1. Con: Loose nukes pose less a threat of nuclear annihilation for humankind than the Cold War stand-off.
1.9.5.3. Pro: By the 1990s there were several atomic powers existing: USA, Russia, France, Great Britain, China, India, Pakistan and Israel.
1.9.5.3.1. Pro: Nuclear weapons have spread to politically unstable states, for example Pakistan which experienced stagflation during the 1990s, a military coup in 1999 as well as an unsuccessful coup attempt in 1995.
1.9.5.4. Pro: During the 1890s people did not suffer from the fears and anxieties that nuclear technology [caused as part of the "risk society"](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=lqyBAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Anxiety+in+a+%27Risk%27+Society&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiwl4bN15bMAhUCFqYKHS8hBDkQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&q=Anxiety%20in%20a%20'Risk'%20Society&f=false) of the 1990's.
1.9.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.4.
1.9.7. Con: Military technologies were better regulated by the 1990s.
1.9.7.1. Con: International law already prohibited the use of chemical weapons by 1899, under the [Hague Convention](https://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention/related-international-agreements/chemical-warfare-and-chemical-weapons/hague-convention-of-1899/).
1.9.7.1.1. Con: Chemical weapons were used despite the prohibition, for example in [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_weapons_in_World_War_I).
1.9.7.2. Pro: The [Chemical Weapons Convention \(CWC\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_Weapons_Convention) has been signed and ratified by the vast majority of states and outlaws the production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons.
1.9.7.2.1. Pro: Chemical Weapons have [not been used](https://www.opcw.org/about-chemical-weapons/history-of-cw-use/) in inter-state warfare since the 1980s \(by Iraq against Iran\).
1.9.7.3. Pro: The [Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty \(NPT\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons) has been signed and ratified by most states, successfully limited the spread of nuclear weapons and established an international regime that monitors states' nuclear capacities.
1.9.7.3.1. Con: Nuclear weapons did not even exit back in the 1890s, thus a regulation of such technology was not necessary.
1.9.7.4. Pro: The [Biological Weapons Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_Weapons_Convention) \(BWC\) banning the production of biological weapons is one example where the spread of a technology was successfully stopped before it came to be used on a large scale.
1.9.7.5. Con: Conventions and treaties \(related immediately to such weapons or their aftermaths, like the [Budapest Memorandum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum_on_Security_Assurances)\) are nice to have on paper, but in practice they do not prevent signatory states from breaking the rules.
1.9.7.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.7.1.1.
1.9.8. Con: -> See 1.1.7.3.1.5.
1.9.9. Con: Street lighting in 1890 was poor compared to 1990
1.9.10. Con: Industrial machines were rarely guarded, and behaved less reliably or predictably in 1890 and so claimed more lives
1.9.11. Con: More people per capita died doing work in 1890 than in 1990
1.9.12. Pro: In 1890, people had not fully understood the concept and destruction of modern warfare and therefore felt safer out of ignorance.
1.9.12.1. Pro: The [estimates](http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/world_war_1.htm) for the duration and costs of World War I were completely illusionary by all parties involved.
1.9.12.2. Pro: The population had not directly [experienced](http://www.bl.uk/world-war-one/articles/changing-lives-gender-expectations) the threat of modern war with its new technology.
1.9.12.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.8.3.4.
1.9.13. Pro: In the 20th century, sophisticated bacteriological and virological techniques allowed the production of significant stockpiles of [weaponized bio-agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_biological_warfare) such as Anthrax and Ricin.
1.9.13.1. Con: Biological weapons were never used on a noteworthy scale in Europe, and certainly not in a way that had any effect on the quality of life of the average citizen of Europe.
1.9.13.1.1. Con: During World War I, biological weapons based on anthrax, glanders, cholera, or wheat fungus were developed and used.
1.9.13.2. Con: The [vast majority](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/bwcsig) of states have signed and ratified the Biological Weapons Convention which bans the acquisition and stockpiling of biological weapons.
1.9.14. Pro: The invention of new drugs made life more hazardous.
1.9.14.1. Con: The invention of new drugs led to tailor made performance enhancing through [steroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid).
1.9.14.2. Con: [Opium, cocaine](http://wings.buffalo.edu/aru/preprohibition.htm) and [heroin](http://www.narconon.org/drug-information/heroin-history-1900s.html) were already used in the late 19th century.
1.9.14.3. Pro: [Ecstasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA#History) has become widespread only in the late 1970s and 1980s.
1.9.14.3.1. Con: Ecstasy \(MDMA\) is regarded as quite [safe and harmless](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/mar/23/constitution.drugsandalcohol) by scientists.
1.9.14.3.1.1. Con: These studies apply to non-stretched drugs and are therefore not applicable to the drugs regular drug addicts are taking.
1.9.15. Con: -> See 1.1.7.3.1.1.
1.10. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.3.1.3.
1.11. Pro: The media was much more diverse and allowed for broader entertainment and information opportunities.
1.11.1. Pro: The development of [video games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_games) began in the mid 20th century. This has been a whole new form of entertainment which became more and more popular.
1.11.1.1. Con: Children are prone for video game [addiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_addiction) which reduces their academic achievements.
1.11.1.2. Con: Video games are creating more [violent](http://time.com/4000220/violent-video-games/) children and thus are a danger to society.
1.11.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.3.1.1.11.2.2.1.
1.11.2. Con: -> See 1.7.1.2.2.
1.11.3. Con: -> See 1.7.1.2.3.
1.11.4. Con: Side products of the diversification of media are negative to Europeans.
1.11.4.1. Pro: Expectations about realistic performance or appearance are blurred more by entertainment in the 1990s than in the 1890s.
1.11.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.6.2.6.1.
1.11.4.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.6.2.6.2.

1.11.4.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.7.6.2.6.5.
1.11.4.2. Pro: Home entertainment creates poor sleeping habits that are negative for the health of society.
1.11.4.3. Pro: Broader and more convenient entertainment leads to obesity because individuals do not need to leave their houses anymore.
1.11.4.3.1. Pro: The likelihood of mindlessly eating unhealthy food increases when watching TV.
1.11.5. Con: -> See 1.3.8.6.1.4.
1.11.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.8.6.1.
1.11.7. Pro: New forms of media technology helped to improve the quality of entertainment.
1.11.7.1. Pro: Cinema evolved as major source of entertainment.
1.11.7.1.1. Pro: In 1990, [64%](http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/downloads/bfi-the-stats-an-overview-of-the-film-television-video-and-dvd-industries-in-the-uk-1990-2003.pdf) of UK citizens indicated to have been to a cinema.
1.11.7.1.2. Con: -> See 1.7.1.2.2.2.1.
1.11.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.6.2.

1.11.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.2.2.7.
1.12. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.3.1.4.
1.13. Pro: Progress in the transportation sector made the quality of life better in the 1990s.
1.13.1. Pro: Transportation of overseas fruits was better in the 1990s than it was in the 1890s.
1.13.1.1. Pro: The impact of CO² and O² on [respiration](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=Q4C0Pxm3RvkC&pg=PA98&lpg=PA98&dq=Ethylene+production+19th+century&source=bl&ots=Ij3kCQfzI8&sig=KwgODOvzutPXq-mV1rMtpJC--q4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjOwaDCl9XLAhXFIqYKHcf3Dx4Q6AEIKTAC#v=onepage&q=Ethylene%20production%2019th%20century&f=false) of plants was not yet fully understood by the end of the 19th century. This made it more difficult to transport fruits properly.
1.13.1.2. Pro: The effects of [ethylene](http://ucanr.edu/datastoreFiles/608-355.pdf) were not yet known. This made it difficult to harvest green bananas for shipping because ethylene is used to make them [yellow](http://cwh.ucsc.edu/bananas/Site/Modern%20History%20of%20the%20Banana.html) again.
1.13.1.3. Pro: The [supply chains](http://cwh.ucsc.edu/bananas/Site/Modern%20History%20of%20the%20Banana.html) between producers and consumers were not as effective and required more time. This made shipping more difficult because fruits ripened in between.
1.13.1.3.1. Pro: Farmers [harvested](http://cwh.ucsc.edu/bananas/Site/Modern%20History%20of%20the%20Banana.html) plantains ripe, thus making it susceptible to bruising and spoilage on journeys, especially those of long distance.
1.13.1.4. Pro: [Roads](http://cwh.ucsc.edu/bananas/Site/Modern%20History%20of%20the%20Banana.html) from plantations to harbors were of lower quality often leading to bruises of the produce.
1.13.1.5. Con: Bananas were already traded by [Chiquita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiquita_Brands_International#History) in the 1870s.
1.13.1.6. Pro: Most fruits and plants simply could not get shipped back then, only seeds, seedlings and plants in pots.
1.13.1.6.1. Con: It was possible to ship [frozen beef meat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reefer_ship#History_of_reefers) from New Zealand to the UK in the 1890s.
1.13.1.6.2. Con: -> See 1.13.1.5.
1.13.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.1.1.
1.13.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.1.1.3.5.1.2.2.1.
1.13.4. Con: Postal services to all regions in the world had been established in the 1890s already.
1.13.4.1. Pro: The [RMS Ophir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Ophir) served as a regular link between London and Australia in the 1890s connecting the two far places in a convenient manner.
1.13.5. Pro: Open Borders, visa-free travel \(ESTA excluded\) and affordable jet transportation brought the world "closer" together.
1.13.5.1. Pro: There is already a generation of early twenties up to mid thirties, who got used to it \(the points stated in the upnode\) and grew on those freedoms, being essential for their perception of the world.
1.13.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.1.1.3.2.
1.13.6. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.1.1.3.1.
1.13.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.1.1.3.5.1.
1.14. Pro: One can imagine a better life within 100 years due to improvement of technology and understanding of life in general.
1.15. Pro: In 1890s many nations only aspired to have nation-states of their own - an "acquisition" of sorts that had great value in the understanding of many both in the XIXth century and today. 
In the 1990s, especially after the dissolution of Yugoslavia, most all of Europe's nations have their own nation-states, or at least wider autonomy.
This creates not only subjective fulfilment, but also sets the stage for one less problem to be solved in the coming decades, which is conductive to wellbeing.
1.16. Con: Between the 1890s and the 1990s, human life has become more distanced from the life humanity had before the advent of industrialization.
1.16.1. Con: Humans' understanding of sex and their body became less strained and more natural.
1.16.1.1. Pro: In the 19th century some doctors held that female orgasm [was a disease](http://www.glowm.com/section_view/item/375).
1.16.1.2. Pro: In the 19th century there was a [phobia against masturbation](http://www.glowm.com/section_view/item/375) in Europe.
1.16.1.2.1. Pro: In 19th century Germany there was a male [anti-masturbation](https://prezi.com/dwc2lpaf02e2/sexuality-in-19th-century-germany/) device.
1.16.1.3. Pro: Even common sex practices, such as oral or anal intercourses, were more of a [taboo](http://www.glowm.com/section_view/item/375) by the 1890s than in the 1990s.
1.16.1.3.1. Pro: The protests of 1968 transformed social understanding of body and politics to be more enlightened.
1.16.1.3.1.1. Pro: In France the 1968 protests started with a demand by students to be allowed to [sleep together](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/egalit-libert-sexualit-paris-may-1968-784703.html).
1.16.1.3.1.2. Pro: The modern [Gay Rights Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_revolution#Modern_revolutions) started in wake of the 1968 protests.
1.16.1.3.1.3. Pro: In the early 1960s, the sexual liberation movement was aided by [feminist ideologues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_revolution#Feminism_and_sexual_liberation) in their mutual struggle to challenge traditional ideas regarding female sexuality.
1.16.1.3.1.3.1. Pro: The book '[The Sensuous Woman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sensuous_Woman)' was the first detailed instruction manual concerning sexuality for women and published in 1969.
1.16.1.3.1.3.1.1. Con: [Fanny Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanny_Hill) was already written in the 18th century and described sexual pleasures of women in detail.
1.16.1.3.1.3.2. Pro: In the UK, [Lady Chatterley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Chatterley%27s_Lover) was only becoming legal in the 1960s indicating the changes of society in regards to female erotic.
1.16.1.3.1.4. Pro: The sexual liberation thrive was aided by the discovery of the pill as a tool for contraception. This allowed more people to sleep with each other than before.
1.16.1.3.1.4.1. Pro: In the UK [the pill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_revolution#United_Kingdom) became free of charge for any woman in 1968.
1.16.1.3.1.5. Pro: Sexual liberation in Sweden was interpreted as an [escape](http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/nordeuropaforum/2009-1/marklund-carl-83/XML/) from societal oppression.
1.16.1.3.1.6. Pro: It was only after 1968 that [porn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_revolution#Normalization_of_pornography) became normalized.
1.16.1.3.1.7. Pro: [Premarital sex](http://www.unav.es/icf/main/documentos/Bien_Parents-of-europe.pdf) became acceptable during the 1968 protests and found its expression that 86.5% of European youths found premarital sex acceptable in the 1990s.
1.16.1.3.1.8. Con: The sexual revolution of the 1960s did not actually lead to sex being enjoyed freely, it is [just observed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_revolution#Criticism) in all the fields of culture.
1.16.1.4. Pro: Sexual [ignorance](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/culture-of-love/a-brief-cultural-history-of-sex-938527.html) and misleading ideals turned the 19th century into the most rotten age there has ever been for sexuality.
1.16.2. Con: Infanticide was widespread across the continent in the 19th century. This shows that newborns were regarded with less value than in the 1990s.
1.16.2.1. Con: In the UK, between 1880 and 1900 the number of children born reduced significantly and so did the number of [infanticide](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2173842?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents).
1.16.2.1.1. Pro: Contemporary [observers](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2173842?seq=1#fndtn-page_scan_tab_contents) in Britain suggested that infanticide was rare.
1.16.2.2. Con: [Increases](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2173842?seq=1#fndtn-page_scan_tab_contents) in abortion and contraception reduced the need for infanticides considerably.
1.16.2.2.1. Pro: British women in the 1890s aborted for the same reason as they committed infanticides before. This suggests that the two are [substitutes](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2173842?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents).
1.16.2.3. Con: In the 19th century, high child mortality was the result of [Sudden Infant Death Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_infant_death_syndrome) rather than [infanticide](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2173842?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents).
1.16.2.4. Con: [Single mothers](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=_D5HpyJowPsC&pg=PA288&lpg=PA288&dq=infanticide+rate+1900&source=bl&ots=zpsiJNVF3H&sig=TPWY5-oMD3q1xksDdrtETbZUQ4E&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjS0O75v5nLAhUBFpQKHYPOCsYQ6AEIKjAD#v=onepage&q&f=false) with children became increasingly recognized in 19th century France reducing the need for infanticide.
1.16.2.5. Pro: [Infanticide](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=fayYBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA82&lpg=PA82&dq=infanticide+rate+1900&source=bl&ots=J7JkYl3fPN&sig=LT_lq1omWEGp0xoC6kHOXnhIlkk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjS0O75v5nLAhUBFpQKHYPOCsYQ6AEIRDAI#v=onepage&q=infanticide%20rate%201900&f=false) was the most common crime by women in the 19th century which it was not anymore by the 1990s.
1.16.2.6. Con: Mothers committed infanticide not out of disregard for their children but out of future [considerations](http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/facpubs/806/).
1.16.3. Con: The idea "natural state" is an intellectual concept and not itself natural. Thus there cannot be a value hierarchy between a "natural" and an "unnatural" state.
1.16.3.1. Pro: To determine something as "natural" has the function of morally distinguishing between "good" and "bad". And  without this distinction human action could not be directed towards an end and would result in chaos \(cf. Hobbes' bellum omnies contra omnes, where this distinction has not yet been made, and everything counts as "natural".\)
1.16.3.1.1. Con: The attribute "natural" by no means always has a positive connotation. Social scientists have labeled non-democratic societies as representing a "[natural state](https://web.stanford.edu/group/mcnollgast/cgi-bin/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Limited_Access_Orders_in_DW_-II_-2011.0125.submission-version.pdf)" of social order and the "[state of nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_nature#Thomas_Hobbes)" as one of anarchy.
1.16.4. Pro: There is [technological nature](http://depts.washington.edu/hints/publications/Human_Relation_Technological_Nature.pdf), which can be found in recorded or simulated nature. This already shows the distance that is put between humans and nature.
1.16.5. Pro: Modern communication technology reduced the quality of communication by depersonalizing it.
1.16.5.1. Pro: Using new technologies, such as texting messages via pager, mobile phone or online-chatting is less personal than meeting up with friends and talking to them directly.
1.16.5.1.1. Pro: [Pagers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pager) \(wireless devices that received and displayed numeric messages and/or received and announced voice messages\) were popular in the 1990s.
1.16.5.1.2. Pro: In the 1990s, the 'second generation' [mobile phone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_mobile_phones) systems emerged and introduced a new variant of communication called SMS or text messaging.
1.16.5.1.2.1. Con: The average American user sent [0.4 text messages](http://mashable.com/2012/09/21/text-messaging-history/#W.vLmYt3DaqQ) per month in 1995. This illustrates how scarcely the new technology was used.
1.16.5.1.2.2. Con: Only by [1999](http://mashable.com/2012/09/21/text-messaging-history/#W.vLmYt3DaqQ) text messages could be exchanged between different networks.
1.16.5.1.3. Con: The use of online communication was rare in the 1990s.
1.16.5.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.2.1.1.1.1.
1.16.5.1.3.2. Con: Yahoo Messenger was originally launched in [1998](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Messenger).
1.16.5.1.3.3. Con: AOL Instant Messenger was released in [1997](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL_Instant_Messenger).
1.16.5.1.3.4. Con: The first dedicated online chat service that was [widely available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_chat) to the public was the CompuServe CB Simulator in 1980.
1.16.5.1.3.4.1. Con: One of the first major events, the [wedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CB_Simulator) of *MilesTeg* and *Cinderella*, was attended by only 50 online guests.
1.16.5.1.4. Con: Via these new technologies people could keep contact to others who do not live nearby. Any kind of contact is more personal than not seeing these people at all.
1.16.5.2. Con: Modern communicaton technologies improved the quality of communication, as it was easier and cheaper for everyone to communicate.
1.16.5.2.1. Pro: The invention of the facsimile made written communication easier and faster.
1.16.5.2.2. Pro: In the second half of the 20th century the era of [satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_satellite) began and improved the way humans communicate significantly.
1.16.5.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.16.5.1.2.
1.16.5.2.4. Pro: The [telephone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone) was the first device in history that enabled people to talk directly with each other across large distances. Eventhough it was already invented in the 19th century its use was not widespread until the 20th century.
1.16.5.2.4.1. Pro: In the 1990s almost every household in Europe had its own telephone mainlines.
1.16.5.2.4.2. Pro: Letters require more work and thus are reserved for special persons only. A phone call, in contrast, comes with little costs attached.
1.16.5.2.4.2.1. Con: For a phone call you need to make time while a letter can be written while watching TV.
1.16.5.2.4.3. Pro: In the 1890s people who were not able to speak face to face to someone else were writing letters. Telephones made communication between these people more personal.
1.16.5.2.4.3.1. Con: Letters require a careful consideration of wording and do reveal much about the personality of the author.
1.16.5.2.4.3.2. Pro: When speaking on the phone people can hear each others voices.
1.16.5.2.4.3.2.1. Pro: When hearing someone speak, you can easily detect in which mood the person you are talking to is.
1.16.5.2.4.3.3. Pro: Writing letters is always one-sided and it is therefore not possible to lead a real-time conversation.
1.16.5.2.4.3.4. Con: -> See 1.16.5.2.4.2.
1.16.5.2.4.4. Pro: The telephone helped ease tensions during the Cold War when a direct line between Washington and Moscow was installed.
1.16.5.2.4.4.1. Con: In [reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow%E2%80%93Washington_hotline) the line was using Teletype and later Fax but never a phone.
1.16.5.3. Pro: Modern communication allows to communicate with people far away rather than persons you know and see everyday.
1.16.5.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.16.5.2.4.
1.16.5.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.16.5.1.
1.16.5.4. Con: -> See 1.16.5.1.4.
1.16.6. Con: The entire history of human growth is the attempt to distance ourselves from the sort of life humans had before industrialisation.  That life was unpleasant and unhealthy, and staying close to it is not by itself a virtue.
1.16.7. Con: In 1890 the natural connection between nature and human was already ruptured by a century of industrial modernization.
1.16.7.1. Pro: In artistic and literary naturalism the focus was on the grave effects of technological progress on the very functioning of human beings.
1.16.7.1.1. Pro: Theodore Fontane's "[Die Brück' am Tay](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Br%C3%BCck%E2%80%99_am_Tay)" shows how the efforts of humans to build technological progress - in this case a railway bridge - can be energy-intensive in vain, as it collapses after all.
1.16.7.1.2. Pro: Theodore Storm's "[The Rider on the White Horse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rider_on_the_White_Horse)" deals with the fatale consequences of modernization, here how the focus on modern dike technology leads to death.
1.16.7.1.3. Pro: In "[Bahnwärter Thiel](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahnw%C3%A4rter_Thiel)", Gerhard Hauptmann dealt with the inescapable causes of modernization.
1.16.7.2. Pro: Life has been transformed massively in the late 19th century for the ordinary citizen.
1.16.7.2.1. Pro: The advent of mass newspapers changed the general setting in which one identified his group.
1.16.7.2.1.1. Pro: Newspapers effectively facilitated the advent of national [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagined_community).
1.16.7.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.8.6.1.8.2.
1.16.7.2.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.9.1.
1.16.7.2.2. Pro: There was the first experience of strong [urbanization](http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/westn/urban.html) which made social interactions more complicated.
1.16.7.2.3. Pro: Industrialization changed the way in which individuals experienced [work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_system) as now factories with hierarchical structure, rather than agriculture became dominant.
1.16.7.2.4. Pro: Consumer goods spread with the advent of industrialization in the 19th century leading to a [consumer culture](http://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/articles/the-rise-of-consumerism).
1.16.7.2.5. Pro: By 1890, half of Europe had a decent [railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_rail_transport) network that changed the nature of life.
1.16.8. Pro: Specialized institutions have been created that dehumanize the body and mind.
1.16.8.1. Pro: The treatment of the mad has become increasingly medicalized.
1.16.8.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.3.1.1.6.1.
1.16.8.1.2. Pro: It became increasingly frequent to call a medical doctor instead of a pastor for someone who attempted to commit [suicide](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=Zi-xoFAPnPMC&pg=PA128&lpg=PA128&dq=suicide+rate+1900&source=bl&ots=DDE5W4gbkv&sig=itYeiU1X6rT5asqKCZum4bbubwY&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjc4J2jmu7KAhWCEpQKHaG3CXkQ6AEIXTAH#v=onepage&q&f=false).
1.16.8.2. Pro: Death of the elderly has been taken out of the family context into the [health industry](https://exopermaculture.com/2016/01/19/how-we-used-to-die-how-we-die-now/).
1.16.8.3. Pro: The progress of the hospital system [separates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birth_of_the_Clinic#The_medical_gaze) the patient's body from the patient's identity because physicians started to see the body as seperate field of research.
1.16.8.3.1. Pro: Because of numerous patients the individual is seen as part of a [wider group](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51e3f4ede4b053e5f0062efd/t/51f7e4bae4b088f41b103013/1375200442047/dehumanization-in-medicine.pdf) and deindividualized.
1.16.8.3.2. Pro: In a hospital patients are not structuring their day themselves but the planners, patients experience a loss in agency that leads to [dehumanization](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51e3f4ede4b053e5f0062efd/t/51f7e4bae4b088f41b103013/1375200442047/dehumanization-in-medicine.pdf).
1.16.8.3.3. Pro: Patients are not very similar to physicians because they are ill and have less power. This causes [dehumanization](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51e3f4ede4b053e5f0062efd/t/51f7e4bae4b088f41b103013/1375200442047/dehumanization-in-medicine.pdf) of patients because the need to consult the patient diminished and the experience of power leads him to treat patients as a means to an end.
1.16.8.3.4. Pro: Increasing [mechanization](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51e3f4ede4b053e5f0062efd/t/51f7e4bae4b088f41b103013/1375200442047/dehumanization-in-medicine.pdf) of processes necessary for medical treatment distances the patient from the physician and leads to dehumanization.
1.16.8.3.5. Pro: Because physicians who work in a hospital show [less empathy](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51e3f4ede4b053e5f0062efd/t/51f7e4bae4b088f41b103013/1375200442047/dehumanization-in-medicine.pdf) for their patients there is a process of dehumanization.
1.16.8.3.6. Pro: Because physicians are likely to cause pain to the patient, dehumanization helps to create a [moral gap](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51e3f4ede4b053e5f0062efd/t/51f7e4bae4b088f41b103013/1375200442047/dehumanization-in-medicine.pdf) necessary for the physician.
1.16.8.4. Pro: The need for the establishment of such institutions speaks a clear language for the negative impact humans have had on natural processes.
1.16.8.5. Con: In 1890, humans have been exhibited as [zoological objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_zoo#1870s_to_World_War_II). This was not the case in 1990 anymore.
1.16.8.5.1. Con: In the 1990s Europeans stepped up their game, came up with a [TV show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brother_\(franchise\)) and put humans under permanent surveillance, called out a price money for the last remaining inhabitant and let viewers decide who has to leave the house.
1.16.8.5.1.1. Con: Those people participated voluntarily.
1.16.8.5.1.2. Con: [Big Brother](http://bigbrothercasting.tv) is running a selective audition, while zoos just take exhibition objects according to race regardless of individual characteristic.
1.16.9. Pro: The rapid progress of biomedical technologies has led to the objectification of many natural entities, such as the fetus or embryo.
1.16.9.1. Pro: Also live stock, such as milk-cows, have more and more become milking-machines due to enhancement in antibiotics, hormone therapies etc.
1.16.9.2. Pro: Monkeys, mice and other lab animals have become mere testing grounds for medical, cosmetic and other applications.
1.16.9.2.1. Con: Animals were testing grounds in the 1890s as well.
1.16.9.2.2. Con: Nowadays, animal tests are much more ethical and are aimed to reduce suffering
1.16.9.3. Pro: Prenatal diagnostics,e.g. [Chorionic villus sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorionic_villus_sampling), has enabled child bearing to become product selection \(admittedly on a very costly scale\).
1.16.10. Pro: With modernity '[Non-Places](http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~jread2/Auge%20Non%20places.pdf)' have been created that reduce the significance of place for humans.
1.16.11. Pro: Most people did not live with many family members around them any longer.

1.16.11.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.2.4.
1.16.11.2. Pro: LGBT couples often have less children than homogameous male-female couples.
1.16.11.2.1. Pro: [LGBT's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_adoption_in_Europe) have problems adopting children. This makes it difficult to set up a wider family.
1.16.11.3. Pro: [Female fertility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_fertility_rate) rate decreased. This makes families smaller.
1.16.11.4. Pro: Around 1900, fewer than six percent of all [households](http://realtormag.realtor.org/daily-news/2015/05/22/single-person-households-are-rise) consisted of people who lived alone. By the 1990s, that percentage has jumped to over 20 percent.
1.16.11.5. Con: Single households are not a mere step away from "a natural state", they are also an [expression of women's emancipation](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=no1MCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT1&lpg=PT1&dq=Single+Life+and+the+City+1200-1900&source=bl&ots=cfOHS1lnaC&sig=zweyhab5dgfAryGBaRF2eO1iFIM&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjil9Doo5rMAhUGmpQKHWRKCTMQ6AEIQzAK#v=onepage&q&f=false). Not without reason is Virginia Woolf's essay on female empowerment titled ["A Room of One's Own"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Room_of_One%27s_Own).
1.16.11.6. Pro: The focus was on the individual in the 1990s.
1.16.11.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.16.11.4.
1.16.11.6.2. Pro: People of the 1990s were seen as very hedonistic.
1.16.11.6.2.1. Pro: Techno, a very hedonistic movement, made its breakthrough as a widespread culture in the 1990s, manifested in the Love Parade in Berlin.
1.16.11.6.2.2. Pro: Musical genres like House and Techno as well as the introduction of new party drugs made clubbing more hedonistic.
1.16.11.6.2.2.1. Pro: In earlier times, many were dancing according to certain steps or remained seated. This ended with the advent of clubbing.
1.16.11.6.3. Pro: Religion was not as important anymore and so did religious communities vanish.
1.16.11.6.3.1. Pro: Sunday [Mass attendance](https://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=22222) in Germany is falling significantly since 1988.
1.16.11.6.3.2. Pro: The [relative number of Catholics](http://nineteensixty-four.blogspot.de/2011/12/yes-virginia-there-are-still-christians.html) in Europe decreased between 1900 and 1990.
1.16.11.6.3.2.1. Con: The [absolute number](http://nineteensixty-four.blogspot.kr/2011/12/yes-virginia-there-are-still-christians.html) of Catholics in Europe increased between 1900 and 1990.
1.16.11.6.3.3. Pro: Laws regarding contraception, homosexuality, abortions and women's rights were changed which indicates lessened influence of the Churches.
1.16.11.6.3.3.1. Pro: The Christian Church has been and still is a [strong opponent](http://www.catholicsforchoice.org/news/inthenews/VaticanEthicsGuide.asp) of science and technological, natural scientific advances.
1.16.11.6.3.3.1.1. Pro: The Church opposes the use of contraceptive medicines.
1.16.11.6.3.3.1.1.1. Con: Within the [Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_views_on_contraception#Dissent) there is major dissent against this opposition, so it is not very strong.
1.16.11.6.3.3.1.2. Pro: The Church opposes abortion.
1.16.11.6.3.3.1.3. Pro: The Church opposes cloning.
1.16.11.6.3.3.1.3.1. Con: The Vatican is not opposed to cloning in "[the vegetable and animal kingdoms](http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_academies/acdlife/documents/rc_pa_acdlife_doc_30091997_clon_en.html)".
1.16.11.6.3.3.1.4. Pro: The Church opposes inn vitro fertilization /  fertilisation \(IVF\).
1.16.11.6.3.3.1.5. Pro: The Church opposes the freezing of unfertilized eggs and embryos.
1.16.11.6.3.3.1.6. Con: The Church only opposes biomedical advances and not science in general. This field is special given its societal contestation.
1.16.11.6.3.3.1.7. Con: Many people oppose these biotechnological advances and the Church is merely their agent. Thus it is not the Church to blame but those principals.
1.16.11.6.3.3.1.8. Pro: The Church [opposes](http://stemcellresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/usccb_2008-06-13.pdf) embryonic stem cell research because it regards this as "deliberate killing of innocent human beings".
1.16.11.6.4. Pro: [Marriage rates](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:Crude_marriage_and_divorce_rates,_EU-28,_1970–2011_\(¹\)_\(per_1_000_inhabitants\)_YB15.png) have decreased until the 1990s indicating that there is a trend to be more individual.
1.16.11.6.4.1. Con: A marriage can be understood as a strategic interaction between two individuals and, therefore, does not show the focus shifting away from the individual.
1.16.11.6.4.1.1. Pro: Individuals want to be married.
1.16.11.6.5. Con: The persistence of marriage as an institution shows that the focus remains on the couple.
1.16.11.6.5.1. Pro: Most women above 30 were married in France in 2006, which suggest that in the 1990s this [percentage](https://robertwhiston.wordpress.com/2013/08/28/46/) was even higher.
