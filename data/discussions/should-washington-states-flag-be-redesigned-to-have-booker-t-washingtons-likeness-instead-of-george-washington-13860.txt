Discussion Title: Should Washington State's flag be redesigned to have Booker T. Washington's likeness instead of George Washington?

1. Should Washington State's flag be redesigned to have Booker T. Washington's likeness instead of George Washington?
1.1. Pro: [George Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_and_slavery) was a slave owner.
1.1.1. Con: There are going to be people on the fringe in every situation, no political or historical figure is perfect. George Washington is recognized for his achievements in founding  the country, slavery is a not his main association.
1.1.1.1. Con: However, political failings are one thing and supporting the subjugation of human beings is another, more severe one which is enough to discredit Washington even if slavery was not his main association.
1.1.2. Con: Owning slaves in that time, while despicable and unforgivable, was still the norm.
1.2. Pro: King county, of Seattle, has already redesigned it's logo to depict MLK jr.
1.3. Con: State flags, as well as state steals, are sacred.
1.3.1. Con: Symbols should not be sacred in a democracy. If the will of people is to change them, they should be.
1.3.2. Pro: Personal opinion and preferences do not enter in on the recognition of historical figures, especially the men and women who founded the country. People cannot pick and choose what has happened; it is written in blood and stone. When people start judging the past by present standards, they defeat the purpose of remembering and honoring history; to learn from past mistakes and not repeat them.
1.3.2.1. Con: While people cannot choose what happened in history, in a democratic country, they should be able to choose how they remember and honor such history.
1.3.2.2. Con: Personal opinion and preferences do actually enter into the recognition of historical figures and events because history is an interpretable narrative written by human historians, not a literal record of events or figures as they actually were. Human historians are falliable, and at best make errors of omission or out of subconscious bias. At worst, they cherrypick facts for an agenda.
1.4. Con: The cost of a total flag overhaul would offset any benefit.
1.4.1. Pro: The benefits of a symbolic gesture like this are intangible and limited, while the economic costs are too high for what little is achieved.
1.4.2. Con: Economic cost should not be the only measure to consider when implementing policy.
1.5. Pro: Highlights one of the most impressive individuals in American history.
1.6. Con: Booker T. Washington's legacy, like George Washington's, is also contentious.
1.6.1. Pro: Booker T. Washington's opinions on the need for black Americans to uplift themselves and preference for compromise with whites are no longer in favor with many.
1.6.2. Pro: Washington’s “Atlanta Compromise” is nowadays deemed as a [betrayal](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2009/03/the-tragedy-and-betrayal-of-booker-t-washington/7092/) and a sell-out because "it accepted segregation, and argued against black political agitation".
1.6.2.1. Con: The betrayals do not match up in severity. George Washington claimed to want freedom for all while owning human property, the other claimed to want freedom for all and then fell short of realizing that intention, perhaps quite badly.
1.6.2.1.1. Con: The issue is not only the betrayals of George Washington vs. Booker T. Washington, the question is if there are better individuals to honor.
1.6.3. Con: While no historical figure is perfect, it would be a big symbolic gesture to celebrate an African-American and his achievements.
1.7. Con: Booker T. has no connection with WA state.
1.7.1. Pro: [Booker T.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booker_T._Washington#Early_life) was born in Virginia and developed his career and education in West Virginia and Alabama.
1.7.2. Con: Even with no connection to WA, Booker’s work for the betterment of African American’s lives should be recognized.
1.7.2.1. Con: Booker's work could be recognized in his home state.
1.7.3. Con: Replacing George Washington for Booker T. Washington is a symbolic gesture, not a specific one tied to WA state.
1.7.3.1. Pro: Replacing a founding father who owned salves with an educator and orator who was born a slave and fought against slavery and segregation is a message against racism.
1.7.4. Con: George Washington himself has virtually no ties to Washington state, a territory that became American half a century after his death.
1.8. Pro: A state wide redesign contest would increase interest in both politics and design.
1.8.1. Con: It can also increase racial tensions and provoke conflict and division between those who want the change and those who don't.
1.9. Con: Another possibility would be to have both together on the flag.
1.10. Con: The founding fathers are well loved and should be remembered.
1.10.1. Con: Some US citizens are considering redefining or removing memorials and monuments dedicated to the founding fathers.
1.10.1.1. Pro: People are talking about removing Thomas Jefferson statues and public references.
1.10.1.1.1. Pro: Civil rights activist and minister Al Sharpton has called for the [removal](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/08/17/al_sharpton_defund_the_jefferson_memorial_asking_me_to_subsidize_the_insult_of_my_family.html) of Thomas Jefferson monument.
1.10.1.1.1.1. Con: Al Sharpton's opinions have been [questioned](https://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/08/25/cornell-west-low-quality-al-sharpton-lacks-integrity/) before as lacking credibility.
1.10.1.1.2. Pro: Some Washington DC [residents](https://pjmedia.com/blog/video-d-c-residents-say-take-down-jefferson-memorial-rename-washington-d-c/) want to take down Jefferson Monument and rename city.
1.10.1.1.3. Pro: [Jefferson Memorial](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-thomas-jefferson-confederate-statues-20150624-story.html) entered the national debate when a CNN anchor questioned of the memorial should be taken down.
1.10.1.1.4. Con: Unless a majority or significant number of people are talking about this and want it to happen, it has no merit, there needs to be a wide and democratic consensus.
1.10.1.2. Pro: People are talking about removing George Washington statues and public references.
1.10.1.2.1. Pro: University of Texas had a student [petition](https://www.americanbazaaronline.com/2015/06/29/university-of-texas-students-petition-to-remove-statue-of-george-washington/) about removing George Washington monument.
1.10.1.2.2. Pro: Chicago [Pastor](https://www.discussionist.com/1016239287) calls on Rahm Emanuel to remove George Washington Monument.
1.10.1.2.3. Pro: Some Washington DC [residents](https://pjmedia.com/blog/video-d-c-residents-say-take-down-jefferson-memorial-rename-washington-d-c/) want to take down Jefferson Monument and rename city.
