Discussion Title: Black Panther: Who's Right About Wakanda's Role in the World?

1. Black Panther: Who's Right About Wakanda's Role in the World?
1.1. T'Challa - remaining isolated from the world.
1.1.1. Con: Wakanda remaining isolated is harmful because it means that black people in other nations will not have the ability to migrate to it.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Black people who remain in white counties will find it a lot harder to fulfill their potential and be free of discrimination.
1.1.1.2. Pro: As a [result](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Europe_Underdeveloped_Africa) of [imperialism](https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/the-interrelationships-between-western-imperialism-and-underdevelopment-in-africa-2151-6200-1000112.php?aid=59246), a lot of black individuals live in [poverty](http://www.worldbank.org/en/region/afr/publication/poverty-rising-africa-poverty-report), both in Africa and around the world. Wakanda would be able to take these people in and offer them a chance at material success.
1.1.2. Con: Wakanda will be discovered eventually. Better for it to happen on Wakanda's terms.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Wakanda's power and resources are already known by some individuals around the world as we know from Klaue and the other Avengers who have seen T'challa run around in a panther suit.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Government agencies for most states and a wide variety of private sector firms have strong vested interest in global imaging and mapping.
1.1.2.3. Pro: If Wakanda opens itself up to the world voluntarily, it is less likely to be blamed for having neglected the rest of the world for so long than if it attempts to remain secret and is discovered.
1.1.2.4. Con: Wakanda's technological advancement means that for the foreseeable future, it will be better at concealing itself than the rest of the world is at detecting it.
1.1.2.5. Pro: Wakandans can help shape foreign perceptions of their country by getting ahead of the story. This is a common tactic used in politics to ensure that coverage is favorable.
1.1.3. Con: Its access to knowledge and technologies beyond anything what anyone else in the world possesses obliges Wakandans to share it.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Not helping those in need while Wakanda is able to makes the country guilty of contributing to their suffering.
1.1.3.2. Pro: MCU Earth is regularly subjected to immediate, global, existential threats, including the Chitauri invasion, Sokovian incident and the current Agents of Shield plotline. As a nation with vast resources, unparalleled scientific know-how, and elite special forces, they are uniquely positioned to assist.
1.1.3.3. Pro: Wakanda does not morally deserve its technological superiority, and therefore ought to share the benefits of that superiority with the rest of the world.
1.1.3.3.1. Pro: Wakanda's access to unparalleled knowledge and technology is due to its historical isolation from, and resulting neglect of, the rest of the world.
1.1.3.3.1.1. Con: Wakanda's technology is based on its unique access to vibranium and would have developed in a similar way had they interacted with the rest of the world.
1.1.3.3.1.2. Pro: Had Wakanda remained open to the rest of the world, it would not have the same technological advantage that it possesses today, since the rest of the world would also possess some vibranium technology.
1.1.3.3.2. Pro: Like most wealthy countries, Wakanda is advanced because it focused exclusively on its own development, without fulfilling its duties to help the rest of the world.
1.1.3.3.2.1. Pro: Wakanda was able to focus all of its resources on technological development and advancement because it did not use its resources to help the rest of the world.
1.1.3.4. Con: Wakanda created that technology solely through its own efforts, and therefore does not owe it to the rest of the world to share that technology.
1.1.3.4.1. Con: Wakanda has such amazing technology in part because of its own efforts, but largely because it was naturally endowed with large quantities of vibranium. This is not something that Wakandans morally deserve.
1.1.4. Con: Due to their shared experience of oppression, black people across the world have a moral obligation to support and help each other.
1.1.4.1. Con: Wakandans are not participant in a shared experience of oppression, since they have been isolated from the outside world for centuries.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: Because of this, nothing unites Wakandans and black people in the rest of the world except their skin colour, which is an arbitrary and morally irrelevant characteristic.
1.1.4.2. Con: No one has an obligation to help others if it would endanger their life.
1.1.4.3. Con: Black people within Wakanda do not have an obligation to help individuals that live in other nations and whom they have never met.
1.1.5. Pro: As the only African country to escape colonisation and the only place in the world where black people can prosper without any limitations, Wakanda needs to be preserved at all cost.
1.1.5.1. Con: Wakanda can preserve itself while still opening itself up to the world somewhat.
1.1.5.2. Pro: Wakanda contains virtually untouched and untainted African culture, which does not exist anywhere else in the world.
1.1.5.2.1. Con: There is no such thing as an 'untouched' 'untainted' African culture. Cultures change over time, and borrow from each other so that can adapt to new conditions and grow.
1.1.6. Pro: If Wakanda gives the rest of the world access to its technology, this technology will be used in destructive ways.
1.1.6.1. Con: Wakanda can share its medical and other beneficial technologies with the rest of the world, while still keeping the details of its military technology secret.
1.1.6.1.1. Con: As soon as Wakanda shares any complex vibranium technology with the rest of the world, even if it is benevolent, non-Wakandan scientists will be able to alter that technology in order to develop weaponry.
1.1.6.1.2. Con: Even vibranium medical technology could be used to create something destructive, like a bioweapon.
1.1.6.2. Pro: Nuclear weapons provide evidence of how scientific technologies can have immense destructive potential, and how states immediately seize on this destructive potential: When [nuclear fission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fission#Discovery_of_nuclear_fission) was discovered, it was put to use developing and creating nuclear weapons within 4 years.
1.1.6.2.1. Pro: Since mutually assured destruction probably would not apply to vibranium weapons, vibranium weapons would likely end up being used far more often than nuclear ones.
1.1.6.3. Pro: Since possession of vibranium confers a huge military advantage onto the owner, rival states will engage in a "vibranium arms race" once they become aware of its existence and uses.
1.1.6.3.1. Pro: States engaged in military standoffs \(like the US and China in the South China Sea, or the US and Russia in Eastern Europe\) will be incentivised to invest in vibranium technologies to break the deadlock.
1.1.6.3.2. Pro: If a state's military rival begins developing vibranium weapons technology, then that state has no choice but to develop its own vibranium weapons for fear of being overwhelmed.
1.1.6.3.2.1. Con: This assumes mutual mistrust and a constant state of potential war in the international arena, which is empirically untrue.
1.1.6.3.2.1.1. Pro: The number of major [interstate wars and battle deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/war-and-peace) has been declining steadily and significantly over the past decades.
1.1.6.3.3. Con: Most of the world's Vibranium is in Wakanda, heavily guarded. For this reason it is unlikely other groups could develop Vibranium to the same extent as Wakanda.
1.1.6.3.3.1. Con: If Wakanda opens itself up to the world and shares its technology, this necessarily involves giving other countries access to vibranium.
1.1.6.3.3.1.1. Con: If a state has a competitive advantage from having access to a rare resource, it has no reason to share it freely with the rest of the world. Economically, it is more likely to sell it selectively and at a high price. This makes it unlikely any state other than Wakanda will ever have access to comparable amounts of vibranium.
1.1.6.3.3.1.2. Pro: Wakanda's advanced technological systems are all built using vibranium, and its wealth is due solely to its possession of valuable vibranium. It therefore has very little to offer the rest of the world apart from vibranium, so helping the rest of the world entails giving away vibranium.
1.1.6.3.3.2. Con: There are deposits of [Antarctic Vibranium](http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Vibranium) in the isolated region of Antarctica known as the Savage Land. This could be made into weapons that counter Wakandan Vibranium.
1.1.6.3.3.3. Con: At various points in Marvel history scientists have been able to develop/discover competing metals to Vibranium \([Adamantium](http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Adamantium), [Reverbium](http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Vibranium#Reverbium), [Gravitonium](http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Gravitonium), etc.\). It is unclear why they couldn't do this again to stop a warring Wakanda.
1.1.6.3.3.4. Con: It is not impossible to steal Vibranium from Wakanda. Ulysses Klaue [stole significant amounts](http://comicbook.com/marvel/2018/02/18/black-panther-klaue-mcu-history-revealed/) from Wakanda in the early 1990's.
1.1.7. Con: Since Wakanda is affluent and powerful, its inhabitants have a moral duty to help less fortunate people around the world.
1.1.7.1. Pro: There is no action/inaction distinction - to fail to prevent suffering when one had the opportunity is morally no different than causing it oneself.
1.1.7.2. Pro: Wakanda's wealth and success is built upon arbitrary and geographic luck. Wakandans are privileged by a lottery of birth.
1.1.7.3. Con: Wealth does not confer any additional obligation beyond that of any other person.
1.1.7.4. Con: Wakanda has shown through its past behavior that the morality it adheres to is helping itself. Nobody can confer any other moral obligation on them.
1.1.8. Pro: T'challa's first obligation is to Wakanda's citizens and their security.
1.1.8.1. Pro: Rulers like T'challa are bound by a social contract with their citizens. The people support the state through taxes, fulfillment of civic duties, and respecting laws. In exchange, the sovereign acts in their best interests.
1.1.8.2. Con: Even if T'Challa's first obligation is to his citizens, that doesn't mean that it always trumps his obligations to people outside Wakanda.
1.1.8.2.1. Pro: T'Challa's duties to Wakandan citizens are analogous to the duties between a parent and a child. A parent's first duty is to their child, but a parent can still have an obligation to donate money to charity once their child's basic needs are met.
1.1.8.3. Con: Since T'Challa is not democratically elected, he has no specific duty to his subjects.
1.1.8.3.1. Con: T'Challa is NOT elected, this is correct; however, his fight and acceptance of his kingship DOES automatically obligate him to his subjects.  He takes the responsibility to keep Wakanda safe and continue to help his subjects prosper.  If, this means keeping out all others, then this is want he will do.
1.1.8.4. Pro: Throughout history, the reason and aim of the Black Panther's existence has been to protect Wakanda and its citizens. T'Challa is no different.
1.1.9. Pro: Humanity is flawed. Flawed enough that when it sees others succeeding it tries to bring them down. The same will happen with Wakanda. Jealousy is a very powerful motivator.
1.1.10. Pro: By opening itself up to the world, Wakanda risks exposing its knowledge to the world and will become a target for everyone.
1.1.10.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.
1.1.10.2. Pro: Once the rest of the world becomes aware of the massive technological opportunities in Wakanda - and the massive potential benefit of having exclusive access to that technology - other countries will be incentivised to invade Wakanda and claim the technology for themselves.
1.1.10.3. Con: Wakanda is so militarily advanced that no country would dare to invade it.
1.1.10.3.1. Con: Even if Wakanda can defend itself effectively against conventional military aggression, it is unclear whether it would be able to defend itself against something like nuclear attack.
1.1.11. Con: Wakanda's existence destroys the stereotype that Africans are incapable of running their own nations and being prosperous. For this reason alone, it is important that Wakanda is not isolated from the rest of the world.
1.1.11.1. Pro: Coming out of hiding would empower millions of black people and give them powerful role models to look up to.
1.2. M'Baku - technology and modernisation is dangerous
1.2.1. Con: Technological development is inevitable. It's moving faster in the MCU Earth than our own, due to access to resources like vibranium, Infinity Stones, and alien artifacts, as well as geniuses like Shuri, Tony Stark, Leo Fitz, etc.
1.2.2. Pro: Advanced technology and powers bring about even more powerful threats.
1.2.2.1. Pro: The development of vibranium was what [led](http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Ulysses_Klaue) raiders like Ulysses Klaue to attempt to plunder Wakanda.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: Klaue never could have done this without help from dissident Wakandans.
1.2.2.2. Pro: The presence \(and experimentation with\) the [Infinity Stones](http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Infinity_Stones) on Earth was what led [Thanos](http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Thanos) to forge a deal with Loki to assist his campaign against Earth.
1.2.2.2.1. Pro: Thanos is [likely](http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Thanos) to continue his assault on Earth in order to complete the [Infinity Gauntlet](http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Infinity_Gauntlet).
1.2.2.3. Pro: AI has the potential to destroy humanity.
1.2.2.3.1. Pro: The increasing development of AI will eventually bring about the [emergence](https://www.vox.com/2014/8/19/6031367/oxford-nick-bostrom-artificial-intelligence-superintelligence) of a technological superintelligence which will likely have a detrimental impact on human society.
1.2.2.3.1.1. Con: AI can be programmed to not be hostile to humanity through core programming.
1.2.2.3.1.2. Pro: [Ultron](http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Ultron), one of Tony Stark's most advanced AI technologies, nearly wiped out humanity.
1.2.2.3.1.2.1. Pro: The creation of Ultron led directly to the Battle of Sokovia, which [resulted](http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Battle_of_Sokovia#cite_note-CACW-0) in mass destruction, 177 total deaths, and 474 billion USD in property damage.
1.2.2.3.1.3. Pro: AI is vulnerable to [rogue algorithms](http://www.statepress.com/article/2018/02/spopinion-the-possibility-of-a-i-going-rogue-is-more-than-just-science-fiction) which have the potential to make unethical decisions that harm humanity.
1.2.2.3.1.3.1. Pro: AI are impossible to control or regulate once they have surpassed us completely in abilities and reasoning.
1.2.2.3.1.3.2. Con: This is a problem with programming, but is not inherent to AI.
1.2.2.3.1.4. Con: AI is created by humans and can be stopped by humans through simple failsafe mechanisms.
1.2.2.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.3.1.3.1.
1.2.2.4. Con: Advanced technologies within the Marvel Universe have also led to the defeat of great threats to Earth.
1.2.2.4.1. Pro: Vision, a Vibranium-bodied android created in part from the remnants of Tony Stark's AI J.A.R.V.I.S., [fought and destroyed](http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Vision#Destroying_Ultron) the rogue AI Ultron.
1.2.2.4.2. Pro: [The Arc Reactor](http://ironman.wikia.com/wiki/Arc_Reactor) is helping to fight climate change through its unique form of green energy.
1.2.2.4.2.1. Pro: From what we know, Wakandan vibration technology has even more green energy applications.
1.2.2.4.3. Pro: Wakandan technology and wealth can bring massive humanitarian benefits to the rest of the world.
1.2.2.4.3.1. Pro: Wakandan medical technology could be used to cure diseases or research new medicines.
1.2.2.4.3.2. Pro: Wakanda's wealth could be used to alleviate poverty in Africa and the rest of the world.
1.2.3. Pro: The development of advanced technology has so far given dangerous amounts of power to uncontrolled private entities.
1.2.3.1. Pro: [Justin Hammer](http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Justin_Hammer), CEO of Hammer industries, created a legion of armor suits that nearly killed thousands of people.
1.2.3.2. Pro: Tony Stark's technology has gone out of his control on several occasions.
1.2.3.2.1. Con: Tony Stark was able to ultimately defeat each of these threats on each occasion.
1.2.3.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.3.1.2.
1.2.3.2.3. Pro: [Ironmonger](http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Iron_Monger) stole Stark's technology and tried to kill him with it.
1.2.3.2.4. Con: Tony Stark's technology is likely [not](https://www.inverse.com/article/41480-black-panther-wakanda-vibranium-technology-tony-stark-shuri) as advanced as Wakanda's. Therefore Wakanda is more able to control its harmful externalities.
1.2.4. Con: Wakanda is far less likely to defeat threats without their advanced technology.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Without its advanced technology, including the cloaking field and Vibranium weapons, Wakanda likely would have been discovered and exploited by western imperialist powers, a far greater danger.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: Almost the entirety of the rest of the continent of Africa was subjected to colonization, largely because the industrial revolution gave Europe substantial [technological advantages](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/241899?journalCode=jmh).
1.2.4.1.1.1. Pro: Technological superiority gives militaries a comparative advantage making it easier for colonizers to expand and oppress.
1.2.4.1.2. Pro: Had western imperialist powers conquered Wakanda, internecine warfare on an unprecedented scale \(augmented by vibranium technology\) would have inevitably occurred.
1.2.4.2. Con: M'Baku is not for abolishing technology entirely. He instead understands the dangers of its development, unlike his fellow Wakandans. His stance is the safest for Wakanda moving into the future.
1.2.4.2.1. Con: M'Baku's philosophy leads to complacency and stagnation. Without the continuing drive to innovate and develop Wakandan technology further, the nation will lose what advantages it currently possesses over much of the world.
1.2.4.2.1.1. Con: Even in isolation, M'Baku's [Jabari Tribe](http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Jabari_Tribe) remained a formidable fighting force.
1.2.4.3. Pro: Some of [Shuri](http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Shuri)'s technological innovations, such as her upgraded [Panther Habit](http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Panther_Habit) and [Remote Control Beads](http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Remote_Control_Kimoyo_Beads) were essential in capturing Ulysses Klaue, a great threat to Wakanda.
1.2.4.4. Pro: Wakandan technology played an instrumental role in the defense of Earth during the [Battle of Wakanda](http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Wakanda#Battle_of_Wakanda).
1.2.4.5. Pro: [Kimoyo Beads](http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Kimoyo_Beads) possess numerous capabilities which give Wakanda an edge in conflicts. For example, they can heal injuries which modern medical technology would deem invariably fatal \(as seen in the case of [Everett Ross](http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Everett_Ross), who suffered what should have been a mortal wound but recovered thanks to the beads' medical applications\).
1.2.5. Con: Advanced technology has made the Wakandan quality of life higher.
1.2.5.1. Pro: Staples of daily life like, [mass transit](https://www.citymetric.com/transport/what-s-wakanda-s-trains-public-transport-black-panther-3698), are highly advanced making people's lives easier and happier.
1.2.5.2. Pro: Advanced medical technology improves the health and wellbeing of Wakandans.
1.3. Nakia - support those in need.
1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.10.
1.3.2. Con: A moderate policy can only mitigate black suffering, but will never end it.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Oppressive structures are so deeply entrenched around the world that only very radical systemic change can solve the problems that they create.
1.3.2.1.1. Pro: While colonialism may have ended officially, Western countries still control their former colonies through a relationship of economic dependency.
1.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: 14 former French colonies in Africa are still paying a [colonial tax](https://www.globalresearch.ca/frances-colonial-tax-still-enforced-for-africa-bleeding-africa-and-feeding-france/5547512) to France - one of the conditions for France granting them independence.
1.3.2.1.2. Pro: Stereotypes of [African Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotypes_of_African_Americans), [Africans](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/12/unkind-divisive-elitist-international-outcry-over-trumps-shithole-countries-remark) and Black people more worldwide as uncivilised or savage are widespread across the world and provide a major hurdle to white people ever respecting them as equals.
1.3.2.1.2.1. Con: The attempt of black groups to violently overthrow democratic, albeit imperfect, states will only further this racist narrative.
1.3.2.1.3. Pro: Historical oppression means that African American communities in the present day suffer from [unequal access to education](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/unequal-opportunity-race-and-education/), [high crime rates](https://scholarworks.umb.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context=trotter_pubs), and [gerrymandered districts](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/06/09/how-a-widespread-practice-to-politically-empower-african-americans-might-actually-harm-them/) which exclude them from the political process.
1.3.2.1.3.1. Pro: Achieving change through moderate mechanisms like the democratic process is very difficult if [gerrymandering](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/north-carolina-gerrymandering/527592/) makes it systematically hard for African Americans to have a political voice.
1.3.2.2. Con: The world has made huge progress on difficult systemic issues like [poverty](https://www.economist.com/news/international/21719790-going-will-be-much-harder-now-world-has-made-great-progress) over the past several decades, largely through moderate policies. It is not inconceivable that the same thing could happen with suffering that results from of racial oppression.
1.3.2.2.1. Con: It is easy to disprove the usefulness of moderate policy. For instance, though the 13th Amendment was ratified in 1865, we since have seen the continuous lobbying for policy that functionally enables [the preferential treatment of white over black Americans in criminal justice, and the privatization of prisons for profit off of their free labor.](https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80091741) The transformation of the social status of blacks as a result of moderate policy, particularly in the U.S., has been in many ways inappreciable.
1.3.3. Con: There are different ways to support others and Nakia is unclear about what methods to prioritize. In the end, T'Challa seems to favor exporting aid and resources without opening Wakanda's borders for mass immigration.
1.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.3.5. Pro: Wakanda exists on an Earth that has been endangered by extraterrestrial forces on multiple occasions. The survival of mankind is enhanced by greater international cooperation.
1.3.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.
1.3.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.3.
1.3.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.
1.3.9. Con: Wakanda has no special moral duty to people outside it.
1.3.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.
1.3.9.2. Pro: Wakanda has been isolated from the outside world for centuries. It therefore does not have any sort of close relationship with the rest of the world, and thus has no moral duties to the rest of the world.
1.3.9.3. Con: All people who happen to be born in fortunate positions have moral duties towards people born in less fortunate positions.
1.4. Killmonger - conquering the oppressor.
1.4.1. Con: It is racist and essentializing to imply that white people are ' the oppressor.'
1.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.
1.4.3. Con: Dividing the world in prolonged conflict, that will only end with the death of some of Earth's most powerful forces, will only make Earth \(and Wakanda\) more vulnerable to evil forces.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Given that there are several infinity stones on Earth, we know that [Thanos](http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Thanos) is coming for them. The only hope of stopping him involves all of Earth's hero's \(including Wakanda\) to combine.
1.4.3.2. Pro: [The Hand](http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Hand), one of the largest and most powerful criminal syndicates of all time, has been increasingly active in recent years. A massive war, killing many of the world's heroes, would leave a power vacuum open for them to thrive.
1.4.3.3. Pro: The first cities that would have been drawn into Erik Killmonger's conflict would have been New York City, London and Hong Kong. These are also the cities containing a sanctum that protect the world from mystical invasion. Destruction of these sanctums could have devastating unintended consequences.
1.4.4. Con: Wakanda decides who's right by trial by combat, so having been defeated by the end of the movie means that Killmonger was not right by Wakanda's own rules.
1.4.5. Con: Large-scale warfare is immoral.
1.4.5.1. Pro: Warfare, particularly with Wakanda's destructive vibranium technology, would result in many innocent deaths.
1.4.5.2. Pro: Warfare without clear delimitation of the identity of combatants is likely to result in the deaths of many innocent people.
1.4.5.3. Pro: Killing is immoral, even in self-defense. It is justifiable in self-defense or in protecting innocent lives, but still immoral. Killing should always be the last option. In spur of the moment decisions, it is more justifiable, but the first goal should still be defense by neutralization that does not need to result in death of the attacker.
1.4.5.4. Con: Warfare is moral in special cases where it is necessary in order to prevent an even greater injustice.
1.4.5.4.1. Con: Killmonger's intended global conflict is not one of these situations. While the inequality of blacks in global society is undeniable, it is also undeniably improving through largely peaceful means. It took 145 years, but the US went from slavery to a black president. Certainly there is far more work to do, but the horrific death toll of a world war can't be justified when progress is occurring peacefully.
1.4.5.4.2. Pro: The engagement of the Allies in WWII was justified on these grounds.
1.4.6. Con: Killmonger is just another tyrant. Instead of striving for equality or peace, he attempted world domination.
1.4.6.1. Pro: Killmonger wants to fight oppression. But in the end, he becomes the thing he hated most - an imperialist.
1.4.6.1.1. Pro: Killmonger seized the throne of a country he had never known and destroyed their sacred traditions.
1.4.6.1.2. Con: By responding to white aggression and oppression, Killmonger is categorically different from imperialists, who conquered other countries that had never done anything to them.
1.4.6.1.2.1. Con: Killmonger sought to destabilize and conquer areas of the world such as Hong Kong that did not participate in the colonization of Africa and in fact were themselves victims of white settler colonialism.
1.4.7. Pro: White people have oppressed black people across the world for centuries - the only way of ending this oppression is to fight back.
1.4.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.1.
1.4.7.2. Con: People of all races have been oppressing other people throughout recorded history, it is not a uniquely black and white issue.
1.4.7.2.1. Pro: [Ancient China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_imperialism) was one of the world's oldest and longest lasting empires that assumed for itself the right to rule over all under heaven.
1.4.7.2.2. Pro: Starting in 1895, Japan build a [colonial empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_colonial_empire) across Asia.
1.4.7.3. Pro: So far, white people and Western countries have failed to atone for [slavery](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/27/u-s-owes-black-people-reparations-for-a-history-of-racial-terrorism-says-u-n-panel/) or [colonialism](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/nov/27/enough-of-aid-lets-talk-reparations) in Africa in any meaningful way.
1.4.7.3.1. Con: Over half a million white people lost their lives to end slavery in the U.S.  [civilwar.org](https://www.civilwar.org/learn/articles/civil-war-facts)
1.4.7.3.2. Con: People should not be expected to atone for actions of other people, even their ancestors.
1.4.7.3.2.1. Pro: People should not be held directly responsible for actions that they did not choose.
1.4.7.3.2.2. Pro: Everyone has ancestors who wronged someone else's ancestors.  It is impossible to perfectly balance the scales, and unfair to single any particular group out to require atonement.
1.4.7.4. Pro: Former colonial powers have no interest in granting more rights to either African countries or black people within their borders.
1.4.7.4.1. Pro: In the 2010 [TV series](https://www.facebook.com/BET/videos/1965773880342772/), Belgium, the Vatican, France, the UK and the US all get involved in planning an invasion of Wakanda since they cannot bear seeing an African state independent of their money and ideologies.
1.4.7.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.1.1.
1.4.7.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.1.2.
1.4.8. Con: Such a move would only continue the circle of violence and ultimately not save anyone.
1.4.8.1. Pro: A symmetric war between Wakanda and any major power would have apocalyptic consequences. In a defensive war, the allies would likely utilize at least the threat of nuclear weaponry, and actually use them if Wakanda called the bluff. Wakanda might be able to take out individual nuclear weapons, but it is very unlikely that they would completely deflect a full scale attack by the US or Russia.
1.4.8.2. Pro: Given our understanding of the Marvel universe, it is unlikely that Wakanda would be able to have an impact in a large scale war against the [many](http://marvel.com/comics/characters) heroes that presumably would want to stop one nation's quest towards global domination.
1.4.8.2.1. Pro: The combined force of Wakanda is is not as strong as the combined force of the Avengers and various other heros.
1.4.8.2.1.1. Pro: MCU Earth has an [incredibly high number](http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Earth-199999_Characters) of superhuman individuals, most of whom would resist a global takeover by anyone.
1.4.8.2.1.2. Con: From what we know, Wakandan technology is likely much more advanced than [Tony Stark's technology](https://www.inverse.com/article/41480-black-panther-wakanda-vibranium-technology-tony-stark-shuri), which is available to the Avengers.
1.4.8.2.1.2.1. Con: [Ant Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant-Man#Film) is in possession of [Pym particle](http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Pym_Particles) technology, to which the Wakandans are nowhere near.
1.4.8.2.1.2.2. Con: Tony Stark created, and is close friends with, [Vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_\(Marvel_Comics\)#Film) who has an [infinity stone](http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Mind_Gem) in his head. Even by himself, Vision is more advanced than all Wakandan technology.
1.4.8.2.1.3. Con: This would require them to work together, which has proven difficult at different times in the past.
1.4.8.2.1.3.1. Con: The overthrow of their respective governments would surely motivate the Avengers to work together to a great extent.
1.4.8.2.1.3.2. Con: Not all of the Avengers would have to work together to take on Wakanda.
1.4.8.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: Tony Stark is an adaptable inventor who could invent new weapons to take on the Wakandans.
1.4.8.2.1.3.2.1.1. Pro: Stark was able to create technology that could subdue the Hulk, a feat previously thought to be impossible.
1.4.8.2.1.3.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.8.2.1.2.2.
1.4.8.2.1.3.2.1.3. Con: -> See 1.4.8.2.1.2.
1.4.8.2.1.3.2.2. Pro: The Wakandans would have to take on the Hulk at some point, a difficult task.
1.4.8.2.1.3.2.2.1. Pro: Even if Wakandans eventually defeated the Hulk, he could take out a large portion of their society in one rampage, making them weak to fight others.
1.4.8.2.1.3.2.2.2. Pro: Hulk has some of the [greatest powers](https://screenrant.com/superpowers-you-didnt-know-hulk-has/) of the Marvel universe which Wakanda cannot match.
1.4.8.2.1.3.3. Pro: The Avengers are divided at the end of Civil War.
1.4.8.2.1.3.4. Pro: According to the 2010 TV series, [Captain America](https://www.facebook.com/BET/videos/1965304493723044/) stood no chance when confronting the Black Panther by himself.
1.4.8.2.2. Pro: Even if the Wakandans have an initial advantage through their technology, other states and heroes will inevitably be able to replicate their technology and use it against them.
1.4.8.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.3.
1.4.8.3. Con: The Wakandan rulers would have an understanding of what past oppression looked like and would seek to end it when in power. This is much better than the current regimes in many countries.
1.4.9. Con: Killmonger would be doomed to fail if he got his way.
1.4.9.1. Pro: Most black individuals are not radical enough to support the violent overthrow of their states.
1.4.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.8.2.
1.4.9.3. Con: A sneak attack on the migrating Asgardians making their way to earth could solidify Wakanda's control of the nine realms.
1.4.9.4. Pro: In the US, white people still [outnumber](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045216) black people 6 to 1 and even some vibranium weapons are not going to change that. This ratio is even less favourable in most other countries worldwide.
