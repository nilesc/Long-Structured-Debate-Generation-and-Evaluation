Discussion Title: Should teachers be tested continually for aptitude?

1. Teachers should be tested continually for aptitude.
1.1. Pro: Teachers need to be tested to ensure they are confident using the latest technology to help their students.
1.1.1. Pro: In America, [78%](https://www.eschoolnews.com/2017/11/27/teachers-technology-classroom/) of teachers feel like they have not had the training needed to use technology in the classroom.
1.2. Con: Aptitude tests could be [racially biased](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/18/nyregion/with-tougher-teacher-licensing-exams-a-question-of-racial-discrimination.html).
1.2.1. Con: An aptitude test around the specific requirements necessary to complete the job is indifferent to race.
1.3. Pro: Testing encourages enthusiastic teaching.
1.3.1. Con: Being a good teacher does not necessarily mean you are a good test taker \(and vice versa\).
1.4. Pro: Aptitude tests are the most objective way to evaluate a teacher's ability.
1.5. Con: Aptitude testing discourages people from wanting to join the teaching profession.
1.5.1. Con: Aptitude testing discourages weaker candidates from joining the profession, and this is not a bad thing.
1.6. Pro: The threat of aptitude tests means that only people that want to be teachers will become teachers.
1.6.1. Con: In India,[99%](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/99-fail-test-for-school-teachers/articleshow/17848944.cms) of aspiring teachers failed the Central Teacher Eligibility Test in 2012, showing that, even though they wanted to become teachers, they couldn't.
1.7. Con: Teachers already experience a high workload with relatively low pay; testing will only make a difficult job harder.
1.7.1. Pro: Teachers will have to spend time preparing for and taking aptitude tests, rather than helping their students learn.
1.7.2. Con: Doctors are held to a very high standard their entire careers; as a large influence on children's lives, teachers should expect to be held to the same standard of care.
1.7.2.1. Con: Doctors receive much greater pay for their work, while teachers often have to work multiple jobs these days to get by.
1.7.2.1.1. Con: The market sets the rate of pay for doctors and teachers. There is a high demand for a relatively-limited supply of top doctors. Teachers are as important as doctors, but there are far more teachers than doctors, thus the lower pay. However, as teachers are as important, standards should still be high.
1.7.3. Pro: The [costs](https://wsvn.com/news/local/over-200-south-florida-teachers-fired-after-failing-state-certification/) of preparing for and taking aptitude tests are prohibitively high.
1.7.4. Con: It will not "only" make a difficult job harder. It will also ensure the important job is being done by qualified individuals. This discussion is not about whether teaching is easy or hard.
1.8. Pro: Implementing testing will mean that "bad" teachers are more likely to be found out and eliminated from education.
1.8.1. Con: Because aptitude tests usually cover a variety of topics that don't always focus on the teacher's expertise, testing could also eliminate good teachers.
1.8.2. Con: According to one [study](https://economics.mit.edu/files/2202), state mandated teacher testing is associated with increases in teacher wages, but not a corresponding increase in quality.
1.9. Con: Dwindling enthusiasm is a normal part of getting older in the same profession; teachers cannot be expected to hold the high level of care that they have coming into the profession 60 years onward.
1.9.1. Con: It is unfair for students to learn from a teacher who isn't passionate about teaching.
1.10. Pro: Raising the standard of employment will mean that public opinion and perception of teaching will positively increase.
1.11. Con: If enough teachers leave the workforce because of aptitude tests, there may be a shortage of staff leading to more student per teacher and worse quality of education.
1.11.1. Con: It would be better to have fewer high quality teachers than many teachers who can't pass an aptitude test.
1.11.2. Pro: The USA is already facing a [crisis](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/americas-new-education-crisis-a-teacher-shortage/) of teachers leaving the profession for higher paying jobs.
