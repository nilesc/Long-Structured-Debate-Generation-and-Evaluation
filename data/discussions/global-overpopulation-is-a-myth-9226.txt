Discussion Title: Global overpopulation is a myth.

1. Global overpopulation is a myth.
1.1. Pro: Predictions about population growth and population information may be unreliable.
1.1.1. Pro: In 2000, [UNICEF](https://www.unicef.org/newsline/2003/03fsbirthregistration.htm) estimated some 50 million births went unregistered. We cannot know if the world is overpopulated if we don’t even know its population.
1.1.2. Pro: The UN recently revised its [population growth](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/population-paradox-europes-time-bomb-888030.html) predictions: from expecting 11.5 billion by 2050, experts now claim that the peak will be at 9.5 billion people around 2070, and then it will begin to decline.
1.1.2.1. Pro: And the faster we reduce poverty, the lower the [peak](https://www.gapminder.org/answers/will-saving-poor-children-lead-to-overpopulation/) will be.
1.1.2.2. Con: If all humans stopped eating meat, a highly unlikely occurrence in any scenario, scientists predict that Earth could have a maximum human carrying capacity of [10 billion](https://www.livescience.com/16493-people-planet-earth-support.html). A global population of 9.5 billion would be catastrophic to human life. We would most likely run out of food and freshwater long before the proposed population decline around 2070.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: According to [Harvard Scientist Edward O. Wilson](https://www.livescience.com/16493-people-planet-earth-support.html): "If everyone on the planet agreed to become vegetarian, leaving little or nothing for livestock, the present 1.4 billion hectares of arable land \(3.5 billion acres\) would support about 10 billion people." Since it is virtually impossible to keep every human on Earth from eating meat or raising livestock, we will be unable to support the food supply for 10 billion humans in 2050.
1.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: 700 million tons of domesticated animals, 300 million tons of humans, 100 million tons of wild animals should say something \( numbers from[Homo Deus book, Yuval Noah Harari](http://www.ynharari.com/book/homo-deus/)\). Vaclav Slim presents the things very accurately in [his books](http://books.google.fr/books/about/Should_We_Eat_Meat.html?id=PLaYN1RpemwC&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button&redir_esc=y). A change of profile consumption would be better.  If some people can reduce the consumption of meat, other can do as well.
1.1.2.3. Con: [Logics of demography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LyzBoHo5EI&list=PLjKbuqA_Sz_Bn3gqpWF5FwPLOuqseHHTg) suggest that population will inevitably reach 11 billion by the end of this century.
1.1.3. Con: Predictions about population growth don't impact whether we are or not already overpopulated.
1.1.3.1. Con: The value of how many people we have is informed by how many people they will make in the future.
1.1.4. Con: In 1910 it was said that world will not survive 2 billion people but today it is 7 billion and counting. If you believe in creator, he would have created a plan to self control population.
1.1.4.1. Pro: The creator did create a plan; war, famin, pestilence, and death.
1.1.4.2. Con: Just because a previous prediction based on different data was wrong doesn't mean that any prediction about the same subject is always wrong.
1.1.5. Pro: The minimum amount of resources needed by a human to have a good life is not defined yet.
1.1.6. Pro: Population predictions fail to take into account that rising wealth and prosperity is strongly correlated to a declining birthrate. The wealthiest nations in the world have a sub-replacement fertility rate, and the impoverished as a percentage of the population has been [declining for a century.](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-population-in-extreme-poverty-absolute)
1.1.6.1. Con: There is significant debate over what percent of the population can exist at Western consumption rates for energy and resources. It is that very consumption that is doing the physical damage to the environment not simply the the number of people. If everyone was a subsistence farmer we would have one carrying capacity and if everyone lived in a modern Western consumer society we would have a radically different capacity.
1.1.6.2. Pro: Empowering and educating women, along with supporting people in old age, and giving them opportunities to live their own meaningful lives brings birth rates down to replacement rate or lower.
1.1.7. Con: Population growth is exponential, and we have yet lack of natural resources but instead global warming due to our activity on this planet. Also the population statistics tell how many people is registered, and there are millions and millions of people that are living but they are not even registered in the system. So this may get really really worse in a short period of time.
1.1.8. Pro: The world population could be decreased significantly by mass events in the future, canceling out any accelerations of population growth. This creates a state where overpopulation is not an issue. Unfortunately, predictions cannot help us foresee these instances, as they are made by humans and computers that cannot predict the future.
1.1.8.1. Pro: Examples of these mass events are colonizing/living outer space, or minimization by wars, natural catastrophes, diseases or political decisions such as the [China's One-Child Policy.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-child_policy)
1.1.8.2. Pro: Predictions do not account for an unforseen global epidemic.
1.1.8.2.1. Con: Lots of things are possible, that doesn't make it reasonable to believe.
1.2. Con: Earth resources may not be able to sustain human population at its current \(or any physical\) growth due to them being finite.
1.2.1. Pro: The concept of "infinite growth" is a dangerous blind mantra. Resources are finite because of entropy, and we need to handle them with care.
1.2.2. Pro: Our food & water supply system is based on finite energy sources. Which by definition means we currently can't sustain our global population indefinitely.
1.2.3. Pro: Food resources can only provide for so many, there is a limit, there isn't an infinite amount of food to go around.
1.2.4. Con: We may  be able to harvest from other planets before this is true.
1.2.4.1. Con: It's not guaranteed that other planets will have all the resources needed and harvesting from other planet could be [more expensive](https://www.ulalaunch.com/rockets/atlas-v) than the actual gains from the harvest operations.
1.2.4.2. Con: If we cannot grow food in our own desserts on our life abundant planet we have zero chance of growing food on lifeless planets. There might be another planet in deep space with life but chances are we will be extinct before we can develop he means to travel there. Not in our lifetime.
1.2.5. Con: But current population is supported, so this only points to some future unspecified population level not yet reached.
1.2.5.1. Con: [Famine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine) is a current issue in many parts of the world \(Nowadays mainly in Africa\).
1.2.5.1.1. Con: Any current issue of starvation is not an issue of quantity available but rather one of [distribution](https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-03-27/drought-doesnt-cause-famine-people-do), [poverty](http://www.wfp.org/stories/what-causes-hunger),[war and conflicts](http://www.bread.org/what-causes-hunger), and [totalitarian](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/17/opinion/weapons-north-korea-hunger.html) [dictatorships](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/17/world/americas/venezuela-children-starving.html).
1.2.5.1.2. Con: The fact that famine affects some parts of the world applies to local overpopulation. However, it does not prove or disprove global overpopulation, as it is simply providing an example of a famished area.
1.2.6. Pro: Global population continues to grow.
1.2.6.1. Pro: The rate of growth reached a maximum in 1968, but the world population has not peaked and continues to [grow unsustainably](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/).
1.2.6.1.1. Con: [Fertility rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_fertility_rate) are projected to [continue decreasing](https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Publications/Files/PopFacts_2017-3_The-end-of-high-fertility.pdf)
1.2.6.1.1.1. Con: Due to [Population momentum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_momentum), the already high population is projected to keep growing for at least one generation span.
1.2.6.1.1.2. Pro: Increased family planning, especially in the Third World, has, is and will be a factor that reduces the global birth rate to more sustainable levels.
1.2.6.1.1.2.1. Pro: Since 1970 there have been [substantial increases](http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/family/trendsContraceptiveUse2015Report.pdf) in contraceptive use and decreases in the unmet need for family planning
1.2.6.1.1.3. Pro: Some countries have [negative population growth](https://www.thoughtco.com/negative-population-growth-1435471), which causes them \(the countries\) to want more people than less.
1.2.6.1.1.3.1. Pro: Some countries are not able to reverse their population growth, no matter how hard they try, such as Japan's [declining population](https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20180413/p2g/00m/0dm/080000c) not helped by the failure of its [Abenomics](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-26/five-years-of-abenomics-the-good-the-bad-and-the-sluggish).
1.2.6.1.1.4. Con: Advancement in medical research indicates that the 'falling fertility' argument doesn't remain valid.
1.2.6.1.1.4.1. Pro: With newfound acceptance of LGBT rights, more options are opening up for people to have a child where they did not exist prior.
1.2.6.1.1.4.2. Pro: After the success of IVF became headline news, more and more [fertility options](https://www.babycenter.com/0_fertility-treatment-getting-started_4089.bc) became available to the public.
1.2.6.1.1.4.3. Con: [Contraception](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/fda-approves-the-pill), a medical advance intended to create more freedom \(in reproductive and gender rights for women\), is one of the reasons for the [decline in birth rates](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/04/29/why-is-the-teen-birth-rate-falling/).
1.2.6.1.1.4.3.1. Pro: This is combined with better [healthcare and better pay for women](https://www.newsmax.com/US/abortion-pregnancy-birth-rates-contraception/2015/06/12/id/650256/) to get contraceptives that makes them more effective than ever before.
1.2.6.1.1.4.4. Con: More pollutants and stress are in a person's life that could cause people to be [infertile](https://www.clevelandclinic.org/reproductiveresearchcenter/info/2011/Rizk-D_duPlessis-S-2013.pdf) more than before, which might explain the rise in [male infertility](https://www.clevelandclinic.org/reproductiveresearchcenter/info/2011/Rizk-D_duPlessis-S-2013.pdf).
1.2.6.1.1.4.5. Pro: Advancements helped female infertility either [go up or at the very least not change](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr067.pdf).
1.2.6.1.1.4.6. Con: Even though the biological fertility has been improved by medical advances, the population fertility, defined as its birthrate, is falling because of social factors.
1.2.6.1.1.4.6.1. Pro: People engage less often in long term relationships, then have less babies.
1.2.6.1.1.4.6.2. Pro: Alternatives forms of pleasure to sex keep increasing with economic growth, leading to [lower fertility rates](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-017-0953-1).
1.2.6.1.1.4.6.2.1. Pro: [Sex robots](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/sex-robots-could-biggest-trend-7127554) could increase that trend.
1.2.6.1.1.4.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.1.1.2.
1.2.6.1.1.4.7. Con: The fact that medical technologies are now more able than ever to combat biological infertility, does not detract from the fact that biological and social factor are making fertility rates decrease in developed countries.
1.2.6.1.1.5. Con: Some religions propagate the idea that having more children is a requirement for the Religion to grow and take over the world. There are a vast number of muslims who practice that in real life.
1.2.6.1.1.5.1. Con: Data on population growth includes them
1.2.6.1.1.6. Pro: The rate of population growth already peaked at 2.1%/year in the late 1960s. [It has been in decline ever since](https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth).
1.2.6.1.1.7. Pro: Infant mortality is no longer falling as fast as before, leading to lower population growth
1.2.6.1.1.8. Pro: As less prosperous regions become healthier and more affluent, birth rates decline significantly. Underpopulation may actually be of a concern in the coming decades.
1.2.6.1.1.9. Con: The rate of population growth [has been falling](https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth) and are [expected to fall to 0](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/population-paradox-europes-time-bomb-888030.html) before the turn of the century.
1.2.6.1.1.10. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.1.1.4.6.1.
1.2.6.1.1.11. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.1.1.4.6.2.
1.2.6.1.1.12. Pro: We have already reached "peak child", that is, the number of children in the world is no longer increasing. [gapminder.org](https://www.gapminder.org/news/world-peak-number-of-children-is-now/) and [ourworldindata.org](https://ourworldindata.org/peak-child)
1.2.6.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.6.1.1.9.
1.2.6.1.3. Con: Malthus claimed population growth couldn't sustain when there were only a billion people. He was [wrong](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-malthus-is-still-wrong/).
1.2.6.2. Pro: According to [Harvard Scientist Edward O. Wilson](https://www.livescience.com/16493-people-planet-earth-support.html): "If everyone on the planet agreed to become vegetarian, leaving little or nothing for livestock, the present 1.4 billion hectares of arable land \(3.5 billion acres\) would support about 10 billion people." Since it is virtually impossible to keep every human on Earth from eating meat or raising livestock, we will be unable to support the food supply for 10 billion humans in 2050.
1.2.6.2.1. Con: Global food production is more than enough to feed the global population, the problem is getting it to the people who need it. [\(from the FAO\)](http://www.fao.org/organicag/oa-faq/oa-faq7/en/)
1.2.6.2.1.1. Con: It is impractical to provide fresh food from Nebraska to South Africa. Food waste there does not mean it is possible transport it there at reasonable cost.
1.2.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.1.1.1.
1.2.6.4. Con: -> See 1.2.6.1.1.
1.2.6.5. Pro: World population has [historically](http://worldpopulationhistory.org/map/1/mercator/1/0/25/#) remained under 1 billion until the start of 20th century. In just 100 years it has multiplied by [more than 7](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/).
1.2.6.5.1. Con: Population growth does not imply negative consequences
1.2.6.5.2. Con: And in the 100 years it [won't even double](https://ourworldindata.org/peak-child).
1.2.6.6. Con: However, as people are raised out of poverty they do not require or desire to have as many children. Eventually, 2 parents are replaced by 2 \(maybe 3\) children. Thus, population growth is minimal, or ceases, capping off at a sustainable maximum.
1.2.6.7. Pro: Unlike any other point in history the world's population has doubled in the past 50 years and doubled in the 50 years before that. The [dramatic change in the rate of population increase](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/) has impacted almost every facet of life on earth.
1.2.6.8. Con: -> See 1.2.6.1.1.9.
1.2.6.9. Con: Per Capita incomes [positive effect on life expectancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preston_curve) has diminishing returns. It's much easier to increase life expectancy from 50 to 80 than from 80 to 110.
1.2.6.10. Con: The fact that the population grows is not enough to determine if there's overpopulation since resources available need to be taken into account.
1.2.6.11. Con: If overpopulation were that harmful, lifespans and life conditions for most humans on Earth would not have improved greatly in the last centuries.
1.2.6.11.1. Con: Two centuries is not very long at all, on an evolutionary time scale.  We cannot know if increased life span is a succesful adaptation, yet.
1.2.6.11.2. Con: The lifespan of humans have doubled, but in the same time other species are disappearing because of our impact on the environment.
1.2.6.11.2.1. Pro: The natural environment is undergoing a severe collapse due to human activity.
1.2.6.11.2.1.1. Con: "Collapse" can not be used from an objective standpoint. Environmental change is inevitable, yet, it is not a sign of overpopulation. Sudden decline in numbers is a sign of overpopulation.
1.2.6.11.2.1.1.1. Con: However, environmental collapses foreshadow human ones. One precedes the other. Without resources, humans will not survive. Thus, environmental collapse is an adequate sign of overpopulation, not just human population decreases.
1.2.6.11.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Environmental collapse does not equate a lack of resources. A decrease in biodiversity is filled with the increase in numbers of individuals of remaining species. A decrease in resource availability forces either improved efficiency or a search for new sources.
1.2.6.11.2.1.2. Con: The environment in the West is the cleanest it has been in 100 years. No acid rain, ozone depletion reduced, drinking water is available. This demonstrates that man can and does make positive changes. We certainly have more to go with third world countries and plastics but we are nowhere near what Ironbridge gorge was in 1790. [www.timeout.com](https://www.timeout.com/newyork/things-to-do/nycs-waterways-are-the-cleanest-theyve-been-in-years)
1.2.6.11.2.1.3. Pro: If the environment collapse, it will be challenging to feed the human pollution.
1.2.6.11.2.1.3.1. Pro: Cannibalism might become the only remaining solution.
1.2.6.11.2.1.3.1.1. Con: Becoming vegans would be more likely than cannibals, as cannibalism is generally forbidden by our current mainstream morals.
1.2.6.11.2.1.3.1.1.1. Con: It may still become a viable practice in a few thousand years.
1.2.6.11.2.1.3.1.2. Con: Cannibalism is not an option as it is likely to make people appear "mad" due to the [prion disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuru_\(disease\)) affecting the brain.
1.2.6.11.2.1.3.2. Pro: The fish stocks are collapsing.
1.2.6.11.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: Tuna need protection & restrictions have been imposed that reflect the severity of the current state of the game. How much Tuna sushi do the Japanese consume every year? It is bit like restricting the eating of say a giraffe. I heard two lady hunters killed a giraffe & it fed a village. Tuna is a good barometer of deep ocean fishing gone wrong.
1.2.6.11.2.1.3.2.2. Pro: Due to the amount of fishing done by humans, fishermen worldwide are catching less and less adult fish, because they do not get enough time to grow \(due to too many mouths to feed with a limited source of fish\). [www.worldwildlife.org](https://www.worldwildlife.org/threats/overfishing)
1.2.6.11.2.1.3.3. Con: Over the last 200 years, [Global hunger plummeted](https://ourworldindata.org/slides/hunger-and-food-provision/#/title-slide) as [human population exploded](https://www.learner.org/courses/envsci/unit/text.php?unit=5&secNum=4)
1.2.6.11.2.1.3.3.1. Con: It's all based on mechanical and chemical farming. Both will be much harder with oil and gas extraction peaks coming.
1.2.6.11.2.1.3.3.1.1. Pro: In [1900s](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/agriculture/) a farmer could produce food for a family of 5, today he can produce food for 100 more people.
1.2.6.11.2.1.3.3.1.2. Pro: Nitrogen fertilizers depends on Gas extraction \(source in french: [www.azote.info](http://www.azote.info/environnement-et-azote/les-bilans-environnementaux.html) \)
1.2.6.11.2.1.4. Con: Reducing population would not lead to everyone being more respectful of the environment.
1.2.6.11.2.1.4.1. Con: However, it would indeed reduce the amount of humans polluting and harming the environment.
1.2.6.11.2.1.4.2. Con: Population reduction may allow us to de-urbanise and live more harmoniously and sustainably with the environment.
1.2.6.11.2.1.4.3. Pro: Wealthier people and greedy businesses might take resources away from the masses.
1.2.6.11.2.1.4.4. Con: Still a reduced population leads to reduced unsustainable behaviour and increased measures sustainable for the environment, because the equilibrium between natural resources and humans remains in place.
1.2.6.11.2.1.4.5. Con: It does if you reduce the population by those people who disrespect the environment. Especially those people who disrespect the environment and who are in charge of companies that disrespect the environment.
1.2.6.11.2.1.5. Pro: The increased electrical power for both home and transport will add tons of ever increasing pollution into the mix. This could dramatically effect the quality of life on our one planet.
1.2.6.11.2.1.5.1. Con: With sufficient efforts, energy production could be shifted to renewable, non polluting sources.
1.2.6.11.2.1.5.1.1. Pro: Moving to renewable energy moves the consumption problem from hydrocarbon fuel chains to rare earth metals, something we are already drastically increasing consumption of year on year.
1.2.6.11.2.1.5.1.2. Con: Replacing 11 billion metric oil equivalent tons of un-renewable energy with "clean" energy \(that represents 1 billion metric oil equivalent tons today\). There is a 1 to 10 factor. We might not succeed to reach that target
1.2.6.11.2.1.5.1.3. Con: Wind and solar energy are not manipulable and thus are not matching our consumption requirements.
1.2.6.11.2.1.5.1.3.1. Con: While wind and solar energy alone can't match our requirements, we can use them together with other more flexible renewable energies. For example, [hydropower can fill the gaps](http://encyclopedie-energie.org/articles/hydropower-vital-asset-power-system-increased-need-flexibility-and-firm-capacity) when no wind or sun power is produced. So the mix of many energy sources can match our consumption requirements.
1.2.6.11.2.1.5.1.3.2. Con: Generation of wind and solar energy are not manipulable in time and space but distribution of energy is.
1.2.6.11.2.1.6. Con: We are and will be more and more capable of addressing out environmental concerns through technology to ensure our survival.
1.2.6.11.2.1.6.1. Con: All technological so-called progress has even greater disadvantages on the long run.
1.2.6.11.2.1.6.2. Con: The [IPAT-equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_%3D_PAT) shows from the ever-increasing Impact, that the efficiency growth of Technology does not compensate enough for the growth of Affluence and Population.
1.2.6.11.2.1.6.3. Con: The environment is not just about survival of humans or the human species.
1.2.6.11.2.1.6.4. Con: Technology is only a sign of the humans overpopulation. Technology made it possible to profit more and more from earth's resoures like trees and oil in an unsustainable manner. The increased profit from earths resources led to a circumstance where more people can be feeded without the lack of food. This circumstance is not the normal balance of the ecosystem and will stop working at some point in future as resources on earth are limited.
1.2.6.11.2.1.6.4.1. Con: Technology can hardly be said to be in and of itself a bad thing. The neutrality of technology makes it good or bad depending only on its purpose and employment. If those in power choose, technology can be used to improve virtually every problem the human race faces.
1.2.6.11.2.1.7. Con: We are seeing an increase in food production and Global Greening as C02 rises. [abc.net.au](http://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2016-04-26/global-snapshot-shows-how-humans-are-greening-the-earth/7346382), so therefore we are not seeing an environmental collapse.
1.2.6.11.2.1.7.1. Con: Food production and greenery are not the only elements of the environmental issue: we also have a rapid loss of biodiversity.
1.2.6.11.2.1.7.1.1. Pro: The rapid loss of species \([1](https://thebulletin.org/2016/04/biodiversity-loss-an-existential-risk-comparable-to-climate-change/), [2](https://e360.yale.edu/features/insect_numbers_declining_why_it_matters)\) we are seeing today is estimated by experts to be between [1,000 and 10,000](http://www.cairoclimatetalks.net/events/biodiversity-changing-climate) times higher than the natural extinction rate.
1.2.6.11.2.1.7.1.1.1. Con: The [alarmist article linked](http://wwf.panda.org/our_work/biodiversity/biodiversity/) admits "we don’t know how much there is to begin with, we don’t know exactly how much we’re losing".
1.2.6.11.2.1.7.1.1.1.1. Con: The same [article](http://wwf.panda.org/our_work/biodiversity/biodiversity/) also asserts "we do have lots of facts and figures that seem to indicate that the news isn’t good" and provides several figures about extensive biodiversity loss.
1.2.6.11.2.1.7.1.1.2. Con: We are also [rapidly creating](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/10/23/16317238/humans-create-new-species-biodiversity-extinction) new animal species
1.2.6.11.2.1.7.1.1.2.1. Con: The ecosystem has a very complex equilibrium. Any creation or destruction of species in this ecosystem can break this equilibrium, then further accelerate the rate of species disappearing.
1.2.6.11.2.1.7.1.1.2.1.1. Con: The equilibrium of nature is an enduring myth \([1](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963662505063022),[2](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7spf5)\)
1.2.6.11.2.1.7.1.1.2.2. Con: We are replacing complex and varied species with basic single-function species that serve only anthropocentric purposes. This process is putting in danger the global resilience of nature.
1.2.6.11.2.1.7.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Humans are creating new species by mixing various cow species together to get more meat out of a single cow. However, those cows are not wandering in nature to keep forest investing grassland for example. Humans only value the short-term purpose of feeding themselves a lot of steaks.
1.2.6.11.2.1.7.1.1.3. Con: Biodiversity is not inherently valuable
1.2.6.11.2.1.7.1.1.3.1. Con: The list of values of biodiversity is long, as explained in [this article](http://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/biodiversity/8-main-values-of-biodiversity-explained/30156).
1.2.6.11.2.1.7.1.1.3.2. Con: Animals have [Intrinsic value](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_value_\(animal_ethics\)), not subordinated to man's interest.
1.2.6.11.2.1.7.1.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.11.2.1.7.1.1.3.1.
1.2.6.11.2.1.7.1.1.5. Con: The mass extinction does not include humans.
1.2.6.11.2.1.7.1.1.5.1. Pro: human life is more important than animal life, therefore it is an inherent good to replace wildlife with more humans.
1.2.6.11.2.1.7.1.1.5.1.1. Con: This is a subjective judgement, we have no way to know what's the real value of humans or wildlife.
1.2.6.11.2.1.7.1.1.5.1.1.1. Con: Most humans value human life more than other animals, except maybe dogs and cats. Humans decide what is valuable because humans invented the concept of value.
1.2.6.11.2.1.7.1.1.5.1.1.1.1. Con: Cats value themselves more than humans. Animals also use the concept of value.
1.2.6.11.2.1.7.1.1.6. Pro: Many resource types currently stressed by human populations can be replaced/recover within human lifetimes. However, species extinctions represent a one-way collapse in a commodity; once extinct they will never come back, and richness will possibly take millions of years to recover.
1.2.6.11.2.1.7.1.1.6.1. Pro: Just the fact that we destroyed 83% of all the mammals since we exist should be enough to accept that we're too many. [theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/21/human-race-just-001-of-all-life-but-has-destroyed-over-80-of-wild-mammals-study)
1.2.6.11.2.1.7.1.1.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.11.2.1.7.1.1.6.1.
1.2.6.11.2.1.7.1.1.8. Pro: Even if it turns out to be true that human life can be sustained in spite of larger human population, it may be the case that our contemporary culture is either disinterested in or incapable of sustaining biodiversity and ecosystems for other forms of life alongside us. Our proliferation may be the cause of the continued elimination of many unique forms of life, which in and of itself is an undesirable dimension of human overpopulation.
1.2.6.11.2.1.7.2. Con: It may be that rising CO2 levels within a certain range will have acutely positive effects on vegetative growth , but this may be a parabolic rather than a linear effect \(meaning after a certain point CO2 levels would become detrimental to vegetative growth\). More importantly, the fact that every ecosystem is comprised of a vast web of interdependencies makes vegetative growth intrinsically linked to the continued existence of other forms of life.
1.2.6.11.2.1.8. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.11.2.1.7.1.1.
1.2.6.11.2.1.9. Con: The problem of environment overuse and climate change is not due to overpopulation but because a small part of the world population uses most of the resources and energy.
1.2.6.11.2.1.9.1. Pro: Technological inefficiency and waste could certainly be reduced, and the infrastructure of civilizations could certainly be transformed to more sustainably integrate with the ecosystems and biosphere of which they are parts.
1.2.6.11.2.1.9.2. Con: As population grows exponentially, so does that small portion of the global population which is destructively using and overusing resources. The effects of the growth of that segment of the population may themselves be exponentially amplified due to the complexity of the ecosystem.
1.2.6.11.2.1.10. Con: Deserts can become [green](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3654) again and be fertile land for farm and cool places for cities.
1.2.6.11.2.1.10.1. Con: The article cited as evidence for de-desertification is largely conjectural, and extremely limited in scope. It suggests programs for introducing desert-thriving trees, but at best this would not translate into large-scale renewal of topsoil for a very long period of time, during which the desertification process is potentially accelerating in tandem.
1.2.6.11.2.1.11. Con: Environmental collapse due to humans does not mean that human population is unsustainable.
1.2.6.11.2.1.11.1. Con: The environment provides vital resources such as oxygen, water and food. Without those resources, the humankind would not survive.
1.2.6.11.2.1.11.1.1. Con: These resources need not come from the environment, technology or extraterrestrial harvesting could replace nature to obtain them.
1.2.6.11.2.1.11.1.2. Con: Natural environmental collapse does not exclude human engineered environments with selected desirable species from existing. Therefore, farms and parks could still exist to provide those benefits.
1.2.6.11.2.1.11.2. Pro: It is our moral duty to preserve our environment. We aren't sustainable until we can sustainably fulfill that duty.
1.2.6.11.2.1.11.3. Pro: Severe Environmental collapse can also be attributed to malpractices like: [not really dealing with pollution issues](https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/various-ocean-pollution-facts.php) and [failing to address them even when trying to deal with em](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_tax). [Failing to adopt better ways of doing things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demagogue) and [failing to learn from each others mistakes](https://nypost.com/tag/neo-nazis/)...repeatedly. [Failing to recognize mistakes of others, as mistakes](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/nov/11/indonesia-forest-fires-explained-haze-palm-oil-timber-burning) and implementing those mistakes in your home. These things could be fixed rather simply and with them Environment. Overpopulation is not a cause, [it's an effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_boom).
1.2.6.11.2.1.11.3.1. Con: It's not so simple to fix the malpractices, otherwise they would already have been fixed by now.
1.2.6.11.2.1.11.3.2. Con: The fact that malpractices contribute to the environmental collapse doesn't exclude that overpopulation also contribute.
1.2.6.11.2.1.12. Pro: Human population growth is causing the destruction of the habitats that the other life forms we share this planet with need to survive.
1.2.6.11.2.1.12.1. Pro: Habitats are being destroyed and animals going extinct due to their homes taken over by greedy overpopulating humans.
1.2.6.11.2.2. Pro: The extreme interdependency within ecosystems suggests that human life may be inextricably linked to the continued survival of these threatened species'.
1.2.6.11.3. Pro: In the Bronze Age \(3200-600 BC\), human life expectancy was around 26 years old, while the world average in 2014 was 71.5 years old, an [increase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy) of 45 years.
1.2.6.11.3.1. Con: This is due to medical technology advances, sanitary infrastructure, and oil based agricultural industry. Not caused by a larger population.
1.2.6.11.4. Con: Life expectancy can increase, due to medical advancements, better diet and health habits, and yet the planet can be leading to overpopulation and end up lacking resources. Both things are not mutually exclusive.
1.2.6.11.5. Pro: Some scientists even suggest that maximum and average life spans may continue to [increase](https://www.livescience.com/59645-no-limit-to-human-life-span.html) far into the foreseeable future.
1.2.6.11.5.1. Con: If humans are able to live longer and longer, and way passed a point where they can be productive, they become only consumers of resources but not producers, which can lead to populations that are difficult to sustain.
1.2.6.11.5.1.1. Pro: While some experts consider that overpopulation and its pressure on resources may not be the most pressing problem, many agree that [aging populations](https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/april-2005/the-real-population-problem-too-few-working-too-many-retired) are indeed a concern. The strain on system that rely on pensions \(where the current workers fund retirees through taxes\) can have dire results.
1.2.6.11.5.1.2. Con: Increases in lifespan have coincided with increases in the longevity of human productivity, since the survival of the body is often contingent on its health and ability to function.
1.2.6.11.5.1.2.1. Con: A body's health can be enough to function \(for example from 65 to 100 years old\) yet that does not mean that  body is healthy and strong enough to work 8 hours a day.
1.2.6.11.6. Con: Life span increases contribute to population growth.
1.2.6.11.6.1. Con: Population growth = Birth rate - Death rate.
Life span does not appear in that equation.
1.2.6.11.6.2. Pro: Overpopulation is not just an effect of birth rate, but is also affected by average life expectancy. Life expectancy [has almost doubled since 1900](https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy). This makes the fertility rates an added issue: as the average population gets older, the production lowers and consumption increases.
1.2.6.11.7. Con: Even though the conditions have improved, they are not yet  perfect.
1.2.6.11.7.1. Pro: There are still [many problems in the world](https://www.kialo.com/what-is-the-worst-world-problem-of-utmost-concern-9143/9143.0/9143.0).
1.2.6.11.8. Con: Lifespan and life conditions improvements are due to our ever increasing consumption of renewable earth resources. In 2018, we have consumed the equivalent of [1.7](https://www.overshootday.org/newsroom/past-earth-overshoot-days/) planets.
1.2.6.11.9. Pro: Advances in technology, such as fertilizer and biotechnology for crops, helps humanity keep expanding the population limit while also providing a better quality-of-life.
1.2.6.12. Pro: The book [Countdown by Alan Weisman](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/books/review/countdown-by-alan-weisman.html) is a well researched evaluation of population growth and its impact on the planet. Weisman reports that "biologists have calculated that an ideal population — the number at which everyone could live at a first-world level of consumption, without ruining the planet irretrievably — would be 1.5 billion." We are now [over seven and growing](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/).
1.2.6.13. Pro: We should have already reached what in System Dynamic they call "limit to growth", but thanks to medicine and economic welfare we're crossing the line. See for instance [Club of Rome](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/02/limits-to-growth-was-right-new-research-shows-were-nearing-collapse).
1.2.7. Con: Awareness of overconsumption, inefficient farming and production methods, and resource waste reduction techniques leads to the implementation of strategies that minimise inefficiencies, wasteful practices and moderate  consumption; this, in turn, ensures sustainable resources for the global population.
1.2.7.1. Pro: Food production [efficiency](https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/advantages-disadvantages-intensive-farming.php) is increasing.
1.2.7.1.1. Pro: Increasing [agricultural water use](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880900002206) efficiency allows to produce more food.
1.2.7.1.1.1. Con: Water use is not the only aspect. Mineral content of soil is also important to produce quality food.
1.2.7.1.2. Con: Intensive food production often leads to [low](http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/science/add_gateway_pre_2011/greenworld/farmingrev1.shtml) [quality](https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/advantages-disadvantages-intensive-farming.php) of food.
1.2.7.1.2.1. Con: There is no [evidence](http://www.who.int/foodsafety/areas_work/food-technology/faq-genetically-modified-food/en/) that [GMF](https://allianceforscience.cornell.edu/blog/mark-lynas/gmo-safety-debate-over) \(Genetically Modified Organism\) is less safe or low-quality food.
1.2.7.1.2.1.1. Con: There is no evidence that genetically modified food is nutritionally superior either, at least to the extent it has been employed in conventional agriculture. Although there is [evidence](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/26/opinion/sunday/breeding-the-nutrition-out-of-our-food.html?pagewanted=all) that both GMO and non-GMO conventionally grown foods are inferior to organically produced foods with regard to nutritional content.
1.2.7.1.2.2. Pro: It's generally accepted that food grown from smaller-scale organic practices is nutritionally [superior](http://naturallysavvy.com/eat/food-then-and-now-how-nutrition-has-changed) to [conventionally](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2005/may/15/foodanddrink.shopping3) grown food \(due to depleted soils, and water-dilution of nutrients\).
1.2.7.1.3. Con: Mass production of captive animals for food is cruel.
1.2.7.1.3.1. Pro: Animals raised intensively in cages lack the natural conditions of well being.
1.2.7.1.4. Pro: Predictions based on current best practice would generate one number. More and more of the food production could be dramatically refined with a higher efficiency. Then it would be sufficient to feed a higher population.
1.2.7.1.5. Con: Optimized production would still be finite, while population growth only regulates itself by the deaths that overpopulation causes. We can therefore raise the population ceiling with agriculture but not prevent population from going over it
1.2.7.1.5.1. Pro: An increase of arable land would also be needed to sustain increasing populations - and arable land of the amounts needed to sustain substantial increases in population isn't available.
1.2.7.1.6. Pro: Agricultural methods that do not require direct planting into the ground are changing the how and where we farm and harvest.
1.2.7.1.6.1. Con: These methods are far more resource intensive than mainstream agricultural techniques, and because of their resource intensity they will face even worse shortfalls of the basic resources needed to grow food for an increasing population.
1.2.7.1.7. Con: Food production efficiency may be increasing in terms of calories/cost but, given the declining nutritional value of mass-produced food, it isn't clear that total world nutritional production is increasing or could sustain substantially higher population levels.
1.2.7.1.8. Con: Current food production rates, or the current rate of food production increase, does not guarantee or indicate that food production will continue to increase into the future or that it can maintain substantial population increases.
1.2.7.2. Pro: We have yet to tap the number one food source on the planet which is cannabis hemp. Not only will cannabis grow in nearly every climate on earth, making it an amazingly abundant food source, it is nature's most perfect food. 

[www.thehealersjournal.com](http://www.thehealersjournal.com/2012/04/21/hemp-seed-the-most-nutritionally-complete-food-source-in-the-world/)
1.2.8. Pro: Space exploration and colonisation may allow us to mitigate against resource deficits or overconsumption.
1.2.8.1. Con: Space exploration leading to colonization is prohibitively expensive approach to trying to solve overconsumption.
1.2.8.2. Con: The time scales required to colonize other planets and extract useful resources are prohibitively long - pushing this proposed solution outside of the time-scales needed to address overpopulation.
1.2.8.3. Con: A far cheaper and faster solution to overpopulation would be to address resource consumption and population growth directly, rather than rely on yet-to-be-developed technology, which may not materialize in time to prevent mass-human-suffering.
1.2.8.4. Pro: Colonizing Mars will lessen the effects of overpopulation on Earth
1.2.8.4.1. Con: The Earth may in fact [not be overpopulated](http://www.kialo.com/global-overpopulation-is-a-myth-9226).
1.2.8.4.2. Con: Colonizing Mars might cause the Earth to gain more population.
1.2.8.4.2.1. Pro: Mars could get overpopulated too and see people moving back to Earth because of it
1.2.8.4.2.2. Pro: Individual martians could decide to move to Earth, which increases Earth's population
1.2.8.4.2.3. Pro: Martians could decide to have children on Earth if they move back
1.2.8.4.2.4. Pro: Earthlings might decide to have more children for the purposes of having enough people to send to Mars
1.2.8.4.2.5. Con: This is not an issue, because when people see Mars abandoned, then people on Earth will go back to Mars. There would be a stabilization point somewhere.
1.2.8.4.3. Con: Colonizing Mars might not help the Earth's population as Earth's population voids could get refilled when people leave for Mars
1.2.8.4.4. Con: There are other options to lessen Earth's population that are less cumbersome than going to Mars
1.2.8.4.5. Pro: Mars will pave the way for colonization on other celestial bodies to provide more choices for when Earth becomes overpopulated.
1.2.9. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.11.2.1.
1.2.10. Con: What is or is not a resource depends on human ingenuity. Oil isn't inherently valuable, we made it valuable with technology. More human brains means more ingenuity which is the ultimate resource.
1.2.10.1. Con: Clean water is an example of resource that we can't substitute: all living being need water. And clean water is scarce in some regions such as in Africa.
1.2.10.1.1. Con: Fresh water is scarce in my home too, until I turn a switch and it comes to me. A scarcity of transportation of fresh water is not a scarcity of freshwater itself.

[Nearly all access](https://extension.psu.edu/the-water-we-drink) to clean water we see today has been the result of human ingenuity that brings water to us \(aqueducts, piping, reservoirs, etc.\), or brings us to water \(cars, trains, planes\)
1.2.10.1.1.1. Con: If bringing water to your house is possible, it is likely because water is not scarce at the scale of your continent. The availability of source water in a continent is primarily related to the amount of rainfall, which isn't controlled by humans. Without that first condition, bringing water to a whole continent requires expensive infrastructures which aren't affordable in developing countries.
1.2.10.1.1.1.1. Con: The only way to build expensive infrastructure in developing countries is by people, through people, with people.
1.2.10.1.1.1.2. Con: Overpopulation didn't create water scarcity in Africa
1.2.10.1.1.1.3. Con: Specialization and trade is how every country gets almost everything they have.
1.2.10.1.1.1.3.1. Con: [Water is different](https://www.beavertonoregon.gov/DocumentCenter/View/5781/Water-Presentation) from other commodities that get transported from country to country
1.2.10.1.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Water is heavy and space intensive.
1.2.10.1.1.1.3.1.2. Pro: Water pipes are expensive, need constant maintenance, and the amount of pipes needed to get water to some parts of Africa is tremendous.
1.2.10.1.2. Con: We can already have the enginuity to  [turn salt water into fresh water](https://adventure.howstuffworks.com/survival/wilderness/convert-salt-water.htm). What can make that process more efficient and cheaper? Human ingenuity.
1.2.10.1.2.1. Con: People living inland of the African continent don't have an easy access to salt water neither.
1.2.10.1.3. Pro: Water scarcity in Africa has never been globally solved yet. With a fast increasing population in this continent, there is no proof that we'll ever be able to fully solve that problem.
1.2.10.1.3.1. Con: Other deserts like Israel and Phoenix have access to water. There's no reason dry areas in Africa can't do the same if they can get systems in place that marshals human ingenuity.
1.2.10.2. Pro: Because oil isn't a sustainable resource, we engineered technologies to harvest sun, wind, and other renewable resources instead.
1.2.11. Pro: Earth is already overpopulated. As the economy of under-developed and developing countries improve, the consumption of natural resources and waste creation will increase. So, if current population start consuming the resources at the same rate as a person in a developed nation, then this will not be a sustainable society.
1.2.11.1. Pro: Behaviour of a population plays a significant role in determining population limits. Capitalistic behaviour puts downward pressure on Earth's carrying capacity for our species. At the same time an economic change which resulted in a reduction in consumerism would elevate our planet carrying capacity as it relates to the human species. [Understanding Population Limits](http://socialrebirth.org/understanding-population-limits/)
1.2.11.1.1. Con: "Reduction in consumerism" just means reduced living standards. The limit on how low that floor can go is well below what it is reasonable to expect people to voluntarily put up with.
1.2.11.1.2. Pro: People can live a quality-of-life similar to before if they male investments that pay off. [LEDs](https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/save-electricity-and-fuel/lighting-choices-save-you-money/led-lighting) are one example.
1.2.11.2. Pro: While it already has more than a billion of people, China has loosened it's one child rule.  The resources may not support such a big a middle class of Chinese people.
1.2.11.2.1. Con: China still caps family sizes to two children. This is sustainable as two children replace the two parents that bore them. In this manner the population size does not increase, it is merely sustained.
1.2.12. Pro: We already use more resources than Earth can sustainably provide.
1.2.12.1. Pro: Maintaining [past level](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/43pek3/scientists-warn-the-un-of-capitalisms-imminent-demise?utm_campaign=sharebutton)s of economic growth are increasingly untenable. Resources, especially energy, are [increasingly costly](https://bios.fi/bios-governance_of_economic_transition.pdf) to harvest. Our government and economies were formulated in an era of cheap, abundant, and easily accessable energy and resources. Back in the 70s, The Club of Rome explored the consequences when a [resource contraction](https://insightmaker.com/insight/1954/The-World3-Model-A-Detailed-World-Forecaster) is introduced into the global economy.
1.2.12.2. Pro: Today humanity uses the equivalent of [1.7 Earths](https://www.footprintnetwork.org/our-work/ecological-footprint/) to provide the resources we use and absorb our waste.
1.2.12.2.1. Con: It is because we don't use the right techniques: the sun alone provides more energy than what we need, not talking about geothermics or streams or tide
1.2.12.3. Pro: Without a Radical restructuring of our economy, and an increase of efficiency of 2x - 6x human civilization will deplete its resources. Current resource use is unsustainable.[no country meets basic needs for its citizens at a globally sustainable level of resource use.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-018-0021-4)
1.2.12.4. Pro: According to most scientific predictions, [Peak oil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_oil) either already happened or will happen soon.
1.2.12.4.1. Con: Other sources of yet more sustainable and renewable energies will replace oil. This trend is already occurring.
1.2.12.4.2. Con: We've been incorrectly predicting peak oil [for over a century](https://paleofuture.gizmodo.com/weve-been-incorrectly-predicting-peak-oil-for-over-a-ce-1668986354).
1.2.12.4.3. Con: If peak oil was on the horizon, futures markets would respond accordingly and it would be reflected in the [price of oil today](http://www.macrotrends.net/1369/crude-oil-price-history-chart).
1.2.12.4.3.1. Con: High oil prices may make new extraction methods more relevant or possible. If the stocks goes up that tends to lower the price.
1.2.12.5. Pro: The amount of arable land, or land suitable for agriculture to support human life is decreasing due to drought, sea level rise, and poor farming practices.
1.2.12.5.1. Con: This is, theoretically, not necessarily a one-way street. Land can be reclaimed, farming practices improved. It's a matter of prioritising this as an area of human endeavour.
1.2.12.5.2. Con: We can prevent this decline by modifying our behavior to not let greenhouses gases take over to the point it causes sea levels to rise.
1.2.12.5.3. Pro: People are not taking much action as whole, which is why this will get worse over time
1.2.12.6. Pro: The demand for water will outstrip supply in [2030](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity). There will be more people than there is water they need.
1.2.12.6.1. Con: This is currently still a matter of infrastructure. Desalination, capturing rainfall, processing waste water, and reducing waste are all possible with current technology. It's the deployment of it that's the hurdle.
1.2.12.7. Pro: Resources are already being depleted much faster than they can be replenished worldwide even at current population levels. [overshootday.org](https://www.overshootday.org/)
1.2.12.8. Con: Overpopulation is only a matter of energy resources. If energy is cheap enough we can solve all water issues by building desalinization plants, we can grow food in the most inhospitable places and we can build cheap homes for everyone.
1.2.12.8.1. Pro: Technology has always surpassed population growth and with fusion energy around the corner the limits of population on Earth grow in the tens of billions.
1.2.12.8.1.1. Con: Technology has not always surpassed population growth. Famine has been present throughout the history and has stopped population growth when technology couldn't keep up.
1.2.12.8.1.1.1. Con: That depends on whether you consider it on a local or global scale. Famine is usually less about the existence of technology than the deployment of it.
1.2.12.8.1.2. Con: Technology doesn't contradict thermodynamics.  The costs of creating food, potable water, clean air, at a temperature that permits life, are all expressible in terms of each other.  Raising corn means burning diesel, raising temperature, reducing clean air.  Entropy steals some.  If Earth is a closed system, there is some hard physical limit on what any technology can deliver.
1.2.12.8.1.3. Con: Just because historically technology has been able to surpass population growth, doesn't mean this trend has to continue. Relying with population planning on a breakthrough which may not come in time, would be globally irresponsible.
1.2.12.8.1.3.1. Con: Even the deployment of current technology would go a long way. With regards much of the rest, we don't need breakthroughs, we need refinement of existing technology.
1.2.12.8.1.4. Pro: A [report](http://www.appg-agscience.org.uk/linkedfiles/IME%20Population%20report.pdf) from the Institution of Mechanical Engineers \(IMechE\) suggests that [many](https://www.theengineer.co.uk/issues/january-2011-online/engineering-sustainable-population-growth/), if not all of the challenges that overpopulation brings "can be overcome by the application of existing engineering expertise".
1.2.12.9. Pro: The Earth is overpopulated, we have caused significant environmental deterioration \(one of the [definitions](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/overpopulation)\). This is especially true if you consider that ~ [37% of land is agricultural](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.AGRI.ZS), and pre-agricultural estimates are in the ballpark of [4 million](https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/j.2326-1951.1995.tb03209.x), yet we currently sit at [7.6 billion](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/?), 1900 times higher.
1.2.12.9.1. Con: [Vertical farms](http://socialrebirth.org/vertical-farms-can-feed-the-world/) currently in use around the world are dramatically reducing the ecological footprint of traditional farms. This shows that [population limits \(a.k.a. biocapacity\)](http://socialrebirth.org/understanding-population-limits/) are tied directly to behavioural propensities.
1.2.12.10. Pro: Overpopulation is the case if the amount of available earth resources is exceeded by the global population and their current living standard. On this basis, since the humanity already exhausted renewable natural resources, we are living on earth credit for the rest of the year \(see [Overshoot Day](https://www.overshootday.org/)\)!
1.2.12.10.1. Pro: If we aren't considering the actual living standard of the people but a "target standard" \(currently displayed by ads and TV\), then the situation is even worse!
1.2.13. Con: If there is not enough resources, people will die and the situation will 'stabilize'.
1.2.13.1. Pro: Every animal population is limited by the [Carrying capacity](http://www.shmoop.com/ecology/growth-rate.html) of its environment, and the population tends to naturally stabilize around that limit because of density-dependant factors. Human will follow the same principle. As our population is still growing, it means we didn't reach Earth's carrying capacity for humans, so we aren't overpopulated.
1.2.13.1.1. Pro: The sustainable ecological carrying capacity of humans has the potential to increase if we become smarter at using our resources.
1.2.13.1.2. Pro: If we were truly surpassing our ecological carrying capacity, governments wouldn't be [paying](http://nebraska.farmergoestomarket.com/index.php/food-technology/341-translating-food-technology-why-do-farmers-get-paid-not-to-grow-crops) farmers [to not grow](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/farmer-earns-pounds-19000-a-year-for-growing-nothing-for-five-years-the-only-crop-on-215-high-1429787.html) on their land.
1.2.13.1.2.1. Con: The "[set-aside](http://nebraska.farmergoestomarket.com/index.php/food-technology/341-translating-food-technology-why-do-farmers-get-paid-not-to-grow-crops)" programs, in which governments pay farmers to not grow their lands was and still is a tool to [regulate prices](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/why-does-the-govt-pay-farmers). This market designed policy which takes place in developed nations does not provide the full picture: depending on the population growth, in the near future, crops could not be enough to feed the population.
1.2.13.1.2.1.1. Pro: It is calculated that with more population as well as negative dietary habits \(like the overconsumption of meat\), the demand for agriculture production will [double](http://www.appg-agscience.org.uk/linkedfiles/IME%20Population%20report.pdf) by 2050.
1.2.13.2. Con: Even if the situation stabilizes, the fact that people died because of a lack of resource is a proof that overpopulation is not a myth.
1.2.14. Con: This is true, however growth can become indefinite if people stop relying on physical resources and became digitized, through methods like mind uploading.
1.2.15. Pro: It is a given that a large part of the population uses so much resources that, if all humanity did the same, humanity would deplete those resources in no time, making life on earth unsustainable. Those already over consuming won't stop, the others strive to consume more. You can argue that as long as most people are fed the way they are, there is no issue. But that is the reasoning of the frog in the not yet boiling water. We must choose what world we want to live in. We are too many as it is.
1.2.16. Pro: Earth is an economic agent mistaken by a simple resource. It has its own timing and limits. Humans are expecting it to adapt itself to the actual rythm of consumption rather than thinking in adapt their consumption to it.
1.2.16.1. Pro: Global overpopulation is not a myth, because it already happened at a smaller scale \(see Easter Island's history \([1](http://www.easterislandquest.com/history-of-rapa-nui.htm), [2](https://imaginaisladepascua.com/en/easter-island-rapa-nui/easter-island-history/)\)\). Since Earth is at a larger scale, overpopulation's effects are harder to see \(hence the myth thoughts\), but it will happen and be larger than before.
1.2.16.1.1. Con: Although overpopulation caused deforestation on the island, it was really the [disease and slavery](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/02/160222-easter-island-rapa-nui-collapse-archaeology-moai-mataa-warfare-weapons-Jared-Diamond/) \(along with associated [violence](http://usslave.blogspot.com/2011/07/slavery-and-disease.html)\) that foreigners brought to the island that became the main use of the population decline, not overpopulation itself.
1.2.17. Pro: No, it's not a myth, it's a cold, hard reality. Planet Earth cannot sustain its growing population unless we bring about a MASSIVE change in: 1\) how humans consume the planet's resources and 2\) how we deal with pollution. Humanity needs to answer these problems before it's too late.
1.3. Con: The fact that some governments have implemented regulations to slow down population growth, proves that over-population is a real concern.
1.3.1. Pro: Necessity dictates. China adopted the one child policy and mostly the people did it.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Apart from contraception, China's one child policy is one of the largest measures with the over population of the planet a recognized phenomenon.
1.3.1.2. Con: [Implementation involved financial penalties, which is coercion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-child_policy#Implementation). Chinese people did not necessarily accept China was overpopulated. The policy did not apply to certain communities, such as rural villagers and traditional ethnic groups, meaning even the government did not accept overpopulation depending on geography and other things.
1.3.1.3. Con: [China removed the One child policy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/29/china-abandons-one-child-policy) when it became clear that it was no longer beneficial.
1.3.1.3.1. Con: The one child policy became a two child policy. Yet it is still a demographic control policy.
1.3.2. Con: Most impacts and foreseen consequences of overpopulation can be attributed to [urbanization](https://www.unfpa.org/urbanization).
1.3.2.1. Con: Urbanization certainly concentrates populations but this does not necessarily mean that urbanization lies at the heart of overpopulation theory.
1.3.2.2. Con: Urbanization may be itself a consequence of overpopulation: all arable lands are already owned  and used to feed the population, then the increasing population cannot buy rural lands and live with it, so they have no choice but moving to cities to seek work.
1.3.3. Con: Governments may have other reasons for slowing the growth of a population.
1.3.3.1. Pro: If the public thinks overpopulation is a problem, governments may respond regardless of if overpopulation is, in fact, a problem.
1.3.4. Con: The fact that governments think something is a problem does not make it true.
1.3.4.1. Con: Governments will often generate solutions to problems that will work best for their particular party and politics. This is the purpose of government.
1.3.4.2. Pro: When a law that is obviously a mistake gets put into practice \(i.e. Roe vs. Wade\) it becomes increasing difficult to remove it due to legislative bureaucracy and emotional attachments.
1.3.4.3. Pro: Good historical examples of this will be the [The Law for Defense of German Blood and Honor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Jewish_legislation_in_prewar_Nazi_Germany#The_Law_for_the_Defense_of_German_Blood_and_Honor) and [Dekulakization.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dekulakization)
1.3.5. Con: Governments react to local overpopulation, this does not imply that there is overpopulation globally.
1.3.5.1. Con: This is more likely explainable to the fact most governments are no longer able to respond flexibly to the issues of overpopulation and city density in the same manner that China can. Most governments are slow and inflexible despite fostering possible interests in things like migration control.
1.3.5.2. Pro: That some governments limits population growth is not scientific proof that there is overpopulation.
1.3.5.2.1. Con: Even though it's not a scientific proof, observing the political actions to reduce population growth is a serious hint based on real facts.
1.3.5.2.1.1. Con: It is perfectly possible that some countries, depending on extension, resources and population are overpopulated while other are not. Government initiatives to control population or boost fertility on a country level may therefore not be a reliable measure to assess if Earth is overpopulated or not.
1.3.5.2.1.2. Con: It is very possible for government policy to ignore or even go against scientific facts.
1.3.5.2.2. Pro: Contrary to the popular belief, [overpopulated](https://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2010/07/population-index-overpopulated) countries are those that have too much population in relation to their environment and resources. Very populated countries like China and India, for example, are in the 29th and 33rd position in the [Overpopulation Index](https://isa-aphumangeography.wikispaces.com/file/view/Overpopulation+Index.pdf).
1.3.5.3. Pro: A problem is not necessarily a problem if Government shows interest in it.
1.3.6. Con: [More countries](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/10-countries-that-desperately-want-people-to-have-more-sex-a7612246.html) nowadays encourage population growth rather than prevent it as aging populations and unsustainable birthrates are a bigger issue than overpopulation.
1.3.7. Con: Some governments have also implemented measures to promote population growth.
1.4. Pro: There is actually no global overpopulation, just an uneven distribution of populations and resources.
1.4.1. Con: An uneven distribution of resources doesn't mean no overpopulation. Both could happen independently of each other.
1.4.2. Con: world human population is bigger than any time before. loss of ecossystems like amazonian and african regions as never had before and all people consuming more food and resources than anytime before. we all have internet, more cars in developed countries, cellphones and everyone can travel more than any time before in history. we have many animals being extinct. of course the world is human over populated. data here: [ourworldindata.org](https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth)
1.4.3. Pro: Many food around the world is thrown away everyday, overpopulation is not the problem, it seems to be more resources misallocation
1.4.4. Pro: [Demographic transition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_transition) states that the global population is still growing, just the growth rate is slowing down. The transition is mostly still taking place in the Sub-Saharan Africa and Arabic countries. These regions are in their second stage \([explosive growth](https://youtu.be/QsBT5EQt348?t=2m44s)\), with high fertility and low levels of mortality. Global overpopulation never happens, as regions overshoot and correct in their temporary transition phases as they reach their ideal: stage four.
1.4.5. Pro: Overpopulation depends on number of children per family, which is inversely correlated with development index. Thus, if the world becomes more equal in wealth, it should not have such a problem. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_and_fertility)
1.4.6. Con: Global population, population distribution, resource \(wealth\) distribution and how we impact the environment are all extensively interdependent. The small parts and locations that have overpopulation problems are just a reflection/foreshadowing of the bigger overpopulation picture. A meaningful discussion on the existence of global overpopulation must address this interdependence in all its social, corporate and political complexity to solve it.
1.4.7. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.
1.4.8. Pro: Most of Earth is uninhabitated. If overpopulation was an issue, then this would not happen. Until we maximize every square inch of the planet \(from the oceans to underground to the sky\), then the Earth is not overpopulated.
1.4.8.1. Con: If all Earth was used by humans, there would be no room for forests \(which are necessary in order to absorb CO2\), nor for biodiversity \(which is necessary in the food chain\).
1.4.8.1.1. Con: Humans can live within forests without cutting down all the trees. Just like how humans can live in the ocean without displacing it and its inhabitants.
1.4.8.2. Con: Some areas are too difficult \(such as dangerous\) to inhabit.
1.4.8.2.1. Con: If we figure out a way to make it possible, then overpopulation would not be an issue.
1.4.8.3. Con: If humans maximized every square foot of Earth, then that would just delay overpopulation and not eliminate it.
1.4.8.4. Con: If humans occupy every square inch of space, then they could cause so much resource damage that overpopulation would really be felt.
1.4.8.4.1. Pro: Humans would breathe out so much CO2 that forests would not be able to handle \(through intake\) the growth and instead overtake it.
1.4.8.5. Pro: Humans can build up \(aka skyscrapers\), thus utilizing the land to maximize the number of people per square foot on it. Overpopulation most likely would not be felt in this regard.
1.4.9. Pro: Earth might not be globally overpopulated, yet overpopulation exists in some regions.
1.4.9.1. Pro: 3 million people live in Dubai. They filter water from the sea for drinking and have seen land levels sink from the overuse of ground water. 'Overpopulation is a myth' is too general of a talking point, when many regions are without question overly populated. For example, Dubai cannot sustain itself within the regional natural water cycle \(i.e. over populated\) and must use work-arounds to survive.
1.4.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.11.2.
1.4.9.3. Pro: Traffic is in gridlock in certain areas.
1.4.9.4. Pro: Some areas might look overpopulated, where there might be underlying issues, such as crowd buildup \(that is why architects try to remove poles from walking areas in buildings, to prevent this from happening\).
1.4.9.5. Con: There might be factors that make the world and certain regions look overpopulated when it is not.
1.4.9.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.2.2.
1.4.9.7. Pro: Overpopulation is not a global problem but local to countries like India and Bangladesh. Most of the problems in post colonial period is primarily rooted at the huge population base of the nations.
1.4.10. Pro: Some people use more resources than others, which makes it seem like there are too many people on Earth that are using up resources.
1.4.10.1. Pro: If all humans wanted to live as they do in the Western world, then there is a population problem. A footprint calculator can tell how many earths would be required if all the people on the planet lived like that.
1.4.10.1.1. Con: This completely ignores human innovation in solving problems. "Necessity is the mother of all invention" and any research will uncover the plethora of ways people are trying to save the planet and reduce our impact.
1.4.11. Con: -> See 1.2.6.
1.4.12. Con: The uneven distribution is evidence of overpopulation, as overpopulation increases rich/poor divide, affecting more strongly the poorest population.
1.4.12.1. Pro: The rich / poor divide can prevent issues around overpopulation being visible to people with more privilege. The [poorest always suffer first](http://www.globalissues.org/article/238/effects-of-consumerism) when finite resources are competed for in a capitalist society.
1.4.12.1.1. Pro: The poor people often don't have enough education and access to internet to clearly express their issues and be heard by the privileged people.
1.4.12.1.2. Pro: Availability of contraception at a price, adds to the rich poor divide. The rich people have less children, on average.
1.4.12.1.2.1. Con: The correlation between the availability of contraception and the decrease in the number of children is not necessarily due to a causation.
1.4.12.1.2.2. Con: Some populations have access to contraception, yet chose to not use it because of cultural values or societal needs. \(Eg: [Nigeria](https://borgenproject.org/nigerias-struggle-overpopulation/)\)
1.4.12.1.3. Con: Simply stating that a part of the population is not able to perceive a set of consequences does not provide evidence for the existence of said consequences.
1.4.12.1.4. Con: Reducing the population or adopting an utopic socialism system would not solve poverty.
1.4.12.2. Con: Equitable access to resources and Universal services ensures an individual's personal wealth does not afford them preferential treatment.
1.4.12.3. Con: Uneven distribution is evidence of a failing economic system, food waste as an example is not the result of overpopulation.
1.4.12.4. Con: Uneven distribution is not itself evidence for or against anything. It may be an indicator that economics are not accurately described by Gaussian math. It could also be that the variation and distribution errors do accurately describe the situation, but at a different scale. Either way, deviation is not the same as error, and outliers should be analyzed individually to determine the ethical or moral issues demanding attention.
1.4.13. Pro: With more wealth and capitalism, it elevates the lowest along with the richest.  The poor in first world countries are richer than most middle class in third world countries.
1.4.14. Pro: Planned obsolescence and the reliance on single-use plastics is the problem, not population.
1.4.14.1. Con: These problems are amplified by overpopulation.
1.4.15. Pro: At the population density of Miami Florida \([4,800 people / sq km](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami)\) we could fit the whole population of the world \([7.6 billion in 2018](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/)\) just in Libya \([1.76 million sq km](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya)\). We have lots of room on the planet for more people.
1.4.15.1. Con: Were Libya populated thus without a supporting infrastructure being put in place, the results would be catastrophic. This demonstrates that the problem is far too complicated to be simplified in this way.
1.4.15.1.1. Con: If we decided to take the course of condensing people's land space, we could invest in making infrastructure necessary to make this possible.
1.4.15.2. Con: Our usage of Earth resource is not only limited to the real estate. Humans have an ecological footprint, and if everyone lived as an American citizen, we'd need [five Earths](http://data.footprintnetwork.org/#/countryTrends?cn=231&type=earth) to sustain our needs.
1.4.15.3. Con: Increased affluence would contribute to a higher resource demand.
1.4.15.4. Pro: Another easier way of looking at it; if the entire population of the earth \(7.6 billion in 2018\) were to divide up the state of Florida \( 170000km^2\), each person would get approximately 250 square feet of living space. If we pretend it is all fertile with water access, and divide it into family units, this is more than enough land for subsistence based micro farming, even before optimizing the farm produce and labour distribution [amazon.ca](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/0997520833/ref=as_li_ss_tl?slotNum=0&ie=UTF8&linkCode=g12&linkId=39deecd62cf06e4f92108eb7d533e688&imprToken=zxpBISrusUrSC1vfuvR5Rw&creativeASIN=0997520833&tag=smallfootpr02-20).
1.4.15.4.1. Con: This might be the case at 7.6 billions but as developing countries continue to grow this will quickly change
1.4.15.4.2. Pro: Living a more [minimalistic lifestyle](https://youngandthrifty.ca/how-much-space-do-you-really-need/), we could live in 100 to 400 square feet of space \(10 to 40 square meters\).
1.4.15.4.2.1. Con: Not everyone is willing to live a minimalistic lifestyle.
1.4.15.4.3. Con: We need more than just food and housing. We also need facilities \(hospitals, firemen station, schools, transports,...\), leisure places \(green parks, theaters, sport fields,...\), and productive places \(to make our furnitures, devices, clothes, generate power,...\). Which means the area we need is much bigger than that.
1.4.16. Pro: Actually, it's a matter of animal over-population. We are trying to feed the entire world with animals, and that takes way more resources than plant food. If we ate less animals, resources would be more abundant.
1.4.16.1. Pro: More crops feeds food than people. Simply switching to [eating beans rather than beef](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/08/if-everyone-ate-beans-instead-of-beef/535536/) is the single greatest impact on climate any industrialised citizen can make. original paper: [link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10584-017-1969-1)
1.4.16.2. Con: While this is true that this would make a decent dent for sure, it only deals with one aspect of resource depletion and carrying capacity. It doesn't deal with overuse of products and limits to carrying capacity for things outside of agriculture. What about the degradation of oceans due to plastic pollution, as a well-cited example? Additionally, eating plant-based increases our carrying capacity but doesn't make it infinite
1.4.16.3. Con: This only makes sense if we compete with animals for food. As long as we don't share our carrying capacity with them \(such as only eating food inedible to humans, like hay\), then animal overpopulation does not really affect us \(outside of climate change contributions\).
1.4.16.3.1. Con: If to consume animals \(in quantities that far exceed actual needs\), humans need an amount of resources that gradually deploy those available, then what we eat does affect the carrying capacity of the planet.
1.4.16.4. Con: Large land areas are not fit for growing crops but excellent for raising livestock. Thus a combination of plant and animal food should be the ideal way to feed the world. Humans are omnivores after all.
1.4.16.5. Pro: A good example is [meat](http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.HTM), which requires lots of resources to be produced and delivers fewer proteins that what was used to create it. This problem is reproduced in many industries and the way we generate energy for final consumption.
1.4.16.5.1. Con: Meat/processed foods represent a waste of resources compared with possible alternative feeding methods, however, they offer at least some value from a human survival viewpoint.
1.4.16.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.1.
1.4.16.7. Pro: The key factor is to change the basic mix with resources. It should be better to develop and promote new forms of food as proteins from insects... less water and raw material to feed stocks.
1.4.16.7.1. Con: That would cause the world population to be more inundated with more animals, not less, without changing overall body mass. Insects would just replace meat equally, animal with animal. Instead, we need to figure out how to lower overall planetary body mass if we are to decrease overpopulation.
1.4.16.8. Con: This solustion simply buys us time, but doesn't solve the problem.
1.4.17. Con: Even if right now better redistribution of resources is the truth of it, there will be a point where we have overpopulated the planet.
1.4.17.1. Pro: This is especially true where if everyone has high-consumptive lifestyles equally \(due to equal distribution\), overpopulation will still take place. Unfortunately, due to the redistribution, it would just happen faster due to more luxurious lifestyles.
1.4.18. Pro: Concerns about overpopulation are mostly disguised [racism](https://theecologist.org/2010/feb/02/fred-pearce-overpopulation-worries-are-potentially-racist-distraction). Generally, the hand-wringers are not worried about there being too many white people.
1.4.18.1. Con: Concerns about overpopulation was an enormous issue in the 1960's and 1970's counterculture movement. Today it is most voiced in the activist environmentalist arena. These groups have not made a distinction between white and non-white. They present no evidence that they are disguising their racism.
1.4.18.2. Pro: Australian demographer Jack Caldwell pointed that Paul Ehrlich’s 'The Population Bomb' focuses its examples on streched-out cities in [poor countries](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/mar/19/overpopulation-cities-environment-developing-world-racist-paul-ehrlich) yet obviates similar situations in white European ones.
1.4.18.3. Con: Overpopulation issues affect mostly African and Asian continents, but the perceived correlation with racism doesn't mean that the concerns are due to racism.
1.4.19. Pro: Mass production, more specifically overproduction drains the majority of our resources rather than the population itself, regulate production according to need rather than profit and our environmental footprint would most likely reach a all-time low in the industrialized world.
1.4.20. Con: -> See 1.2.11.
1.4.21. Con: Intelligent people can identify an excessive species population \(in this case humans\), but the unintelligent can't. So the very unaware people keep reproducing and passing their genes down to the next generations. The chances of a majority of our population being aware of the risk of overpopulation is continually getting lower. The aware beings see the problem but don't pass their great traits of awareness/intelligence down. So fixing the problem gets increasingly difficult.
1.4.21.1. Con: This assumes that awareness is passed down genetically the same way as intelligence or eye color, which is nonsese.
1.4.21.2. Pro: This would mean that the future would look like the one in the movie Idiocracy, where the people are are not that smart overpopulate whereas the ones who are intellectual struggle to have any children and leads to a degraded future where the world struggles just to grow food, because they forgot about water.
1.4.21.3. Pro: The aware beings see the problem but don't pass their great traits of awareness/intelligence down, not allowing them to solve it. This makes overpopulation worse and more uncontrollable over time.
1.4.22. Con: Humans are responsible for many species extinction, also animal cruelty its derivated from overpopulation demands more food resources. Energy resources also are finite we need to control and stop this now!!!
1.4.23. Pro: [Current world population](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/) = 7,643,930,000 [Earth total land mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land#Land_mass) = 148,939,063 km2 \(57,505,693 sq mi\) 7,643,930,000 / 148,939,063 = 51.3 km2 per person \(132.9 sq m per person\).
1.4.23.1. Pro: That's a lot of human resources - the most valuable resource on the planet. We just need to devise a framework and strategy to put these resources to good use and do better for our Mother Earth.
1.4.23.1.1. Con: A list of the most valuable resources on the planet would usually begin with a breathable atmosphere and liquid water.
1.4.23.2. Con: Land is not the only resource we have on Earth
1.4.23.3. Con: Only if you assume that people settle as easily on deserted land as easily as in forested areas.
1.4.24. Pro: There are currently many places on earth, that are overpopulated. However, due to population cycles those problems will eventually solve themselves. More info in [ourworldindata.org](https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth) and [web.archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20070310222535/http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/youthdevelopment/components/6340-02.html)
1.4.25. Con: An even distribution of populations and resources is a utopian dream that is always just one execution away from becoming a reality. It would be attainable to eradicate the sort of extreme poverty that causes families to have more than 2.3 children average per couple, which is the rate that maintains a stable population.
1.4.26. Pro: "If we want to reduce our impacts this century, it is consumption we must address. Population growth is outpaced by the growth in our consumption of almost all resources. There is enough to meet everyone’s need, even in a world of 10 billion people. There is not enough to meet everyone’s greed, even in a world of 2 billion people." [theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/19/population-crisis-farm-animals-laying-waste-to-planet)
1.5. Con: -> See 1.2.6.11.2.1.
1.6. Pro: There are possible solutions that would allow us live sustainably without the consequences of the high population level.
1.6.1. Pro: Malthusian theory has been repeatedly discredited by innovations in farming and food production. For example, humans can now produce 16 times as much wheat per acre as we could in the 1500s. There is no reason to think innovation will stop. [ourworldindata.org](https://ourworldindata.org/yields-and-land-use-in-agriculture)
1.6.2. Con: The need for finding solutions already proves that overpopulation is not a myth but a real problem that needs to be faced.
1.6.3. Pro: The real problem is not over population but overconsumption of unsustainable products.
1.6.3.1. Con: A very large number of products are unsustainable, meaning that it is not a trivial matter to simply cease over-consuming
1.6.3.2. Con: The economic efficiencies that support high population densities are inherently wasteful. For example, centralising food production necessitates the use of packaging and fuel to transport that food.
1.6.3.3. Pro: Plastic toy manufacturing uses multiple resources \(oil, water, labour, electricity etc.\) to produce disposable items with little use in sustaining life, as alternatives exist. The wastefulness creates an unbalance to give the perception of overpopulation, when it's really overconsumption that is the originator of the lack of resources problem.
1.6.3.3.1. Pro: If the resources that go to plastic toy manufacturing is diverted to poverty prevention, then the lack of poverty would lead people to believe that overpopulation is not happening. That is why overconsumption causes people to propagate the overpopulation myth, because it creates a false illusion of too many people using resource instead of vice versa.
1.6.3.3.2. Pro: This problem can be fixed, there are sustainable alternatives to plastic toys, like digital toys/entertainment or resource-free fun games, like tag. The fact that the resource consumption can be reversed, shows the true issue is overconsumption, not overpopulation.
1.6.3.4. Con: If the global population was much smaller, it would not be an issue to overconsume individually.
1.6.3.5. Con: One doesn't exclude the other: we may have both overpopulation and unsustainable consumption.
1.6.3.6. Pro: -> See 1.4.16.5.
1.6.4. Pro: Great areas of planet are still not formed and used; there are possibilities to make [arid areas green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_greening) again, and to [settle at sea](https://www.economist.com/node/21540395) and use a water agriculture. Earth with clever management can without problem feed more people.
1.6.4.1. Con: Large areas of Earth are either not economically viable or are outright inhospitable without expensive long term terraforming projects to render them viable for proper habitation. As the population grows, supporting said population becomes exponentially more expensive per square meter.
1.6.4.1.1. Pro: Most likely people will retreat inland instead of creating 'water worlds', because it is easier and populations are well-established there.
1.6.4.2. Pro: Most of the surface of Earth is ocean. If we can utilize even 5% of it, we would be able to extend the square feet of living space and not run into overpopulation issues \(like overcrowding\).
1.6.4.3. Pro: [Dryland farming](http://cropsfordrylands.com/wp-content/uploads/Dryland-Farming-Crops-Tech-for-Arid-Regions.pdf) could be developed more.
1.6.5. Pro: Global overpopulation is the result of a bad assignment of resources. Mankind has build a big wall that separates the humans from the nature. We have been hiding from the real world, in our artificial concrete prison, giving power to corrupt governments that only think in their own interests. We all must take responsibility for our well-being, then we'll live more sustainably.
1.6.6. Pro: Once people get [digitized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFIdTo5bdJo), then the number of people that can exist is virtually \(no pun intended\) limitless.
1.6.7. Con: It is not sufficient to have 'possible' solutions that 'would' allow us to live sustainably. What we need is solutions that already and actually allow us to live sustainably. Before we apply those solutions, we are overpopulated.
1.6.8. Pro: The number of people the earth can sustain is only dependent on technology, politics and discipline. If all three factors worked together, the earth might be able to sustain doubling or tripling of its current population.
1.6.9. Pro: More people fills the Earth with more labor and ideas. This is so valuable that it rises the optimal number of people acceptable on Earth, despite the negative aspects of our high population.
1.6.9.1. Pro: Humankind is an interesting and valuable step in the Story of Earth: First mineral forms, then organic forms, then basic living forms, then more complex living forms, then smart and creative forms such as humans.
1.6.9.1.1. Con: As far as science go, we don't know for sure if life on earth \(or universe\) is indeed "wanted", or if it is a side effect of randomness.
1.6.9.2. Pro: More people means more brains to solve the world problems, including the problems that our high population causes.
1.6.9.2.1. Con: Solving our world's most important problem \(from an ecological-humanist point of view\) has currently no value by itself in a capitalist society. [We could erase starving from earth with 10% of yearly defense budget](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-military-goals-idUSKCN0X12EQ). 
Therefore our brains are not reserved to do that at massive scale.
1.6.9.3. Con: That we are more acceptable because of our assets doesn't cancel the fact that our high population has some negative effects. The Yang doesn't make the Yin whiter.
1.6.9.4. Con: The negative effects of over population in our current state of social management is not good because a growing larger lower class will produce more abhorrent behaviors due to class separation and low availability of education and other resources, this makes it harder for people to be productive.
1.6.10. Pro: It is a myth because the population itself is not a problem, it depends on what this population does, how they act and what they use. Something like "Earth Overshoot Day" visualises actual problems within the population-count. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Overshoot_Day)
1.6.10.1. Pro: All famines are manmade. They are a result of poor political decisions such a poor economic planning leading to underproduction, distribution decisions such as the decision to export crops during times of natural disaster, despotic regimes which at time engineer famines, commercial waste e.g. disposal of imperfect produce/dumping crops to inflate prices. The earth has the capacity to feed us all, scientific advances allow us to increase that potential. The issue is not in scarcity but supply.
1.6.11. Con: The challenge to deriving solutions is, of course, that borderless cooperation between nations is too much to expect. We are our own worst enemies.
1.6.12. Pro: The capacity for humans to invent and adapt is the greatest resource we have because it has thus far proven unlimited, it increases the output of all other resources, and its effects only increase with population size. If overpopulation is defined by humanity out-growing its resources, then population growth is the cure for its own "disease".
1.6.12.1. Pro: [Simon–Ehrlich wager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon%E2%80%93Ehrlich_wager) is representative of this phenomenon.
1.6.12.2. Pro: While most animals are mostly capable of acknowledging they are in the world and just try to survive \(hence why nature revolves around survival of the fittest\), humans are able to control their destiny \(by manipulating their environment and conditions to survive in them\). Thus, whenever we find a disruptive food technology \(like agriculture and biotechnology\), it creates a population boom. If it can't be sustainable, we innovate a new way to survive, allowing the cycle to continue forever.
1.6.13. Pro: -> See 1.2.12.8.
1.7. Pro: Overpopulation may have been exaggerated or used as a myth to pursue certain agendas.
1.7.1. Con: Overpopulation being a [myth](https://overpopulationisamyth.com/) is an idea supported and promoted by religious-based organizations against abortion.
1.7.1.1. Pro: For example, the [Population Research Institute](https://www.pop.org/our-achievements/) is non-profit founded by a family sociologist, Catholic priest and Benedictine monk that has been [accused](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_Research_Institute#Criticism) of spouting misleading data, not publishing a single peer-reviewed paper in a scientific journal and has been awarded a one out of four in “[accountability and transparency](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=10080)”.
1.7.2. Con: An idea may be exaggerated \(even for good reasons\) yet that does not conclusively prove that the idea is false or a myth.
1.7.3. Pro: "Agendas" essentially relate to pursuing a competitive, high consumption, high impact lifestyle in preference to sharing resources more equitably between a greater number of people. We could sustain 10x as many Indian's as North Americans for example. That's a lifestyle choice. Protecting your own lifestyle over another's right to exist is an agenda.[www.ucsusa.org](https://www.ucsusa.org/global-warming/science-and-impacts/science/each-countrys-share-of-co2.html#.W7ThABMvNTY)
1.7.4. Pro: The logical conclusion of overpopulation is that we are too many, serving -even at a subconscious level- to devalue human life.
1.7.4.1. Pro: This would be the exact opposite of the [Scarcity Principle](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/scarcity-principle.asp) in social psychology, or in markets such as the working force.
1.7.4.2. Con: The motives behind the notion of overpopulation or its psychological impacts do not render the fact \(a population exceeding sustainable limits\) as false or not occurring.
1.7.4.3. Con: Overpopulation's purpose is to value and enhance the life of a few individuals or as many as possible with lifestyle modification \(like vegetarianism or biking\). Realistically, when people overpopulate this world, they devalue their own life. They do not think about the consequences of their proliferation \(like running out of food, water, and shelter due to too many mouths to feed\).
1.7.4.4. Pro: In this regard, it would be used as a justification of wars, murders, poor working conditions, turning beings into things, pollution, etc.
1.7.4.5. Pro: People become numbers in statistics that waste resources instead of being thought of as human beings with needs at times in overpopulation discussions.
1.7.5. Pro: Overpopulation may have been exagerated to make us more aware of environmental issues, or to push forward a 'Climate Change agenda'.
1.7.6. Con: The overpopulation concept has the agenda of making people aware of their negative impact on future generations and how can consciously reduce it. Its message is for the benefit of humanity, not some political, economic, environmental, or other agenda.
1.7.7. Pro: With the current state of communication technology we could "spread out" over the Earth's surface. It appears that there is another agenda involved, perhaps control, that forces people into densely populated cities.
1.7.7.1. Pro: [Agenda 21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenda_21), a non-binding action plan of the United Nations aiming to achieve a global sustainable development, has been often considered -especially by U.S. Tea Party movement activists and others- [a plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenda_21#Opposition) to force citizens to move to cities, among other things of that nature.
1.7.7.2. Pro: [NIMBY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY)s do not like overpopulation, just an increase in cities \([1](https://voxeu.org/article/seven-billion-people-so-why-do-some-fear-population-decline), [2](https://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol25/13/25-13.pdf)\). They use their political influence in city planning using myths that [governments try to dispel](http://www.hcd.ca.gov/community-development/community-acceptance/index/docs/nimby_yimby0507.pdf).
1.7.7.3. Pro: New communication technology, like [5G](https://www.adweek.com/digital/a-look-at-the-future-of-5g-powered-smart-cities/), and the decives its geared towards entices people towards cities. Agendas by companies and entities are for making cities more likable to live in, which draws people in \(to make more money\).
1.7.7.3.1. Con: 5G is not used in cities because of some agenda, but rather because of its [scaling limitations](https://www.arcep.fr/uploads/tx_gspublication/Report-5G-issues-challenges-march2017.pdf). The 5G infrastructure really works best in elevated areas \(like skyscrapers in cities rather than rural plains\) and little is known about how it works with a 'spread out' distribution.
1.7.7.4. Con: Widespread communication is expensive to create and its return on investment \(ROI\) becomes less-and-less the further away the infrastructure is from cities. Theoretically communication can spread out over Earth, but realistically it is not feasible. Logistics is more of a motivator for creating agendas to move people to cities than control is \(although that is a small part of it\).
1.7.7.5. Pro: [Gentrification](http://www.savills.co.uk/research_articles/229130/171784-0) and [super-gentrification](https://macaulay.cuny.edu/eportfolios/goldwyn17/files/2017/01/Super-gentrification-Lees.pdf) draw people into cities, fueled by governments who encourage it.
1.7.7.6. Con: [Rural flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_flight#Economic_determinants) \(a.k.a. urbanization\) is motivated by economic and social 'determinants', rather than agendas.
1.7.7.6.1. Pro: Overpopulation from the Industrial Revolution, not some agenda, is the main reason why cities are built. This is evidenced by the past, where in 1800, only [3%](https://www.english-online.at/geography/world-population/urban-areas.htm) of people lived in cities. People who succeeded in cities \(due to jobs\), built their populations there until we have large cities now and megacities in the future.
1.7.7.6.2. Pro: Most people [prefer](http://attentiv.com/we-dont-speak/) community and in-person communication than that of long-distance relationships. So while communication can be widely distributed, people's propensities \(rather than agendas\) are real drivers in bringing people to cities.
1.7.7.6.2.1. Pro: In the future, people will prefer digital communication \(due to greater preferences in [younger generations](http://attentiv.com/we-dont-speak/)\), which will allow populations to grow outside of cities. Still, this people-, not agenda-, motivated.
1.7.7.7. Con: We cannot spread out over the entire surface, because that would mean the destruction of forests, which are required in order to absorb the CO2 that we produce.
1.7.7.7.1. Pro: Most countries have [protected natural areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_area). Their various regulations ban certain human activities on their limits such as settling in them or even staying overnight, in some. While 18% of EU and 27% of US land mass [is designated as a protected area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_area#By_Area); The biggest example of this is [the entire continent of Antarctica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic#People) with no indigenous population, reserved to scientific research and specialized tourism.
1.7.7.7.2. Con: Environmentalists may be a factor in bringing people to cities though, not out of control, but to prevent people from causing environmental damage.
1.7.7.7.3. Pro: Climate change is a real driver in preventing people from spreading over Earth's surface. Even though there are "climate deniers", it is doubtful that this agenda of theirs is for the purpose of driving people to cities.
1.7.7.7.3.1. Con: Politicians might deny climate change in order to drive people to cities to gain more votes \(because more people = more votes\).
1.7.7.7.3.1.1. Con: A lot of democratic [systems](http://www.democracy-building.info/voting-systems.html) are [proportional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation) and thus often favor less densely populated areas. Therefore, moving people to cities while it may attract more votes, it may also give less representation and thus defeat the purpose.
1.7.7.7.3.1.1.1. Pro: In most representative systems one person’s vote does not have the same weight as another. Because of representation processes, a vote in more populated areas is worth less in terms of actual elected candidates than a vote in a less populated area.
1.7.7.7.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: The US Senate has two senators for every state, no matter the size. \(Thus, for example, the 585,000 people of Wyoming have as much power in the Senate as the 39,000,000 people of California.\) Many argue that this is [systemically unfair](http://gawker.com/5989903/reminder-the-us-senate-should-be-abolished).
1.7.8. Pro: There are ways of life that, purposely or not, tend to decrease fertility.
1.7.8.1. Pro: Some lifestyles tend to to reduce fertility, such as high fat diets \([e.g. fast food](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-fertility-fast-food/eating-fast-food-linked-to-infertility-idUSKBN1IA33B)\) or some commonly found substances \([e.g. smoking](https://yourfertility.org.au/for-women/smoking-and-fertility/)\).
1.8. Con: The ecological principle of a "carrying capacity" applies to humans just as it does to any other living creature.
1.8.1. Con: The principle of [carrying capacity](https://populationeducation.org/what-carrying-capacity/) is actually an argument against the notion of overpopulation, as in some mathematical models, it means that the population of a given species will [decrease](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/ecology/population-growth-and-regulation/a/exponential-logistic-growth) when near reaching carrying capacity thus negating overpopulation.
1.8.2. Con: Human activity, through technology, can increase the available resources \(energy sources, food, etc.\). Huge examples are: agriculture, domestication of animals, the combustion engine, or electricity. Just with working fusion technology our resource availability would skyrocket.
1.8.2.1. Con: Technologies exploit resources; they do not create them. Exploiting more resources with greater efficiency does not change the fact that many of those resources are limited.
1.8.2.1.1. Pro: [Technological advances](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability-and-resource-productivity/our-insights/discover-technologys-impact-on-natural-resources) are changing the way resources are consumed and produced. However, more efficiency in mining or oil can increase efficiency and reshape supply and demand but do not just [create](https://phys.org/news/2009-11-mankind-earth-resources-alarming.html) more [resources](https://phys.org/news/2018-07-humans-depleting-earth-resources-footprint.html).
1.8.2.2. Con: Technology has that capacity indeed. However, in the discussion on a biological term like 'overpopulation' one should deal with actual capabilities, not potential capabilities. Our current technological capabilities can't indefinitely keep up with demand for food and water. Future technologies might.
1.8.3. Con: Even if there is a carrying capacity, the fact that human population is still growing means we haven't reached it yet.
1.8.3.1. Pro: Any species which overpopulates some habitat will start to fall, sometimes quite sharply. Human growth means the world is \(still\) not overpopulated.
1.8.4. Pro: The prefixal use of 'over-' implies that there are limits to the essential resources that sustain human population. Even if birth and mortality rates were to remain constant over time, the availability of these resources over time would be a key indicator of the viability of a population's size. To deny the term 'overpopulation' is to deny either that these limits have been reached, that they exist at all or that equal access to essential resources over time is a social priority.
1.8.5. Pro: Any system that is resource limited follows the [logistic growth model](https://magoosh.com/hs/ap-calculus/2017/ap-calculus-logistics-growth-model/) \(LGM\) described in Calculus. At some point the non-renewable resources are used up and the population has to correct for it.
1.8.5.1. Con: The logistic growth model doesn't lead to overpopulation, as the population levels off/stabilizes at its carrying capacity without overshooting it \(overshooting on a curve is an indicator of overpopulation\).
1.8.5.1.1. Pro: The logistic growth model shows how a population works within its carrying capacity and stabilized within it instead of going over its limitations.
1.8.5.2. Pro: Since overpopulation is when the population cannot support enough people and declines in its growth rate and/or population, the logistic growth model displays that growth slow-down.
1.8.5.3. Con: In reality, an [overshoot curve](https://www.dummies.com/education/science/environmental-science/the-environmental-science-of-population-growth-models/) is a better demonstration of overpopulation, as it explains [Earth Overshoot Day](https://www.overshootday.org/) better and shows how populations go over the carrying capacity, not just work within it.
1.8.5.4. Pro: A population realizes it cannot grow [exponentially](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/ecology/population-growth-and-regulation/a/exponential-logistic-growth) \(even though it is going in that direction\), so it keeps correcting itself. The curve does not show the population be overpopulated, because it already started to happen and took action in time to stop it from getting out of control \(like [overshooting](https://www.dummies.com/education/science/environmental-science/the-environmental-science-of-population-growth-models/)\). Even though the overshoot curve reveals overpopulation visually, that does not mean that overpopulation does not happen in the LGM. With the latter, hindsight corrections are too small to view.
