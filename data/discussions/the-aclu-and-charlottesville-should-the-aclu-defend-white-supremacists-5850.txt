Discussion Title: The ACLU and Charlottesville: Should the ACLU Defend White Supremacists?

1. The ACLU should stop defending the free speech rights of white supremacists.
1.1. Pro: The ACLU defends the peaceful exercise of rights. The tendency for white supremacy demonstrators to [turn violent](https://www.wired.com/story/leaked-alt-right-chat-logs-are-key-to-charlottesville-lawsuits/) causes them to fall outside the traditional purview of the ACLU.
1.1.1. Con: Just because one individual might commit an act of terrorism or violence, should not mean that other individuals lose their basic freedoms. Refusing to protect freedom of speech for fear of violence violates the core beliefs of the ACLU.
1.1.1.1. Con: If a causal link can be drawn between the speech acts of white supremacist organisations and violence committed by individuals, which it can, then it means that the exercise of 'basic freedoms' by white supremacist groups can in some instances themselves be violent and should therefore not be protected.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Supremacy groups have often attempted to normalize racist language and expression to lay the groundwork for racial violence.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: In Rwanda, hate speech against the Tutsis was [commonplace](http://www.rwandanstories.org/genocide/hate_radio.html) at the time of the genocide.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: [Exposure](https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/13457754) to hate speech in Rwanda from Radio RTLM increased participation in genocidal violence.
1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Anti-Semitic hate speech helped [fuel](https://www.ushmm.org/confront-genocide/how-to-prevent-genocide/hate-speech-and-incitement-to-genocide) the atrocities committed during the holocaust.
1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: The [normalization](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-nazi-normalized-anti-semitism-appealing-children-180959539/) of White supremacy came prior to the Nuremberg laws and the holocaust in Germany.
1.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: The propagation of hate speech post 2007 election in Kenyan resulted in an [increase in violence.](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/svnp_policybrief_media_anyango.pdf)
1.1.1.1.1.4. Pro: [Cultural Violence](http://homepage.univie.ac.at/herbert.preiss/files/Galtung_Cultural_Violence.pdf) is any element of a culture that is used to legitimise violent acts, whether these violent acts be structural or direct. White supremacist speech acts clearly fit into the definition of cultural violence. They are a pre-requisite for direct white supremacist violence to occur in the first place, in that they allow attacks on racial minorities to be considered permissible or even desirable.
1.1.1.1.1.4.1. Pro: [Eliminationis](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/worse-than-war/featured/understanding-genocide-eliminationism/26/)t white supremacist rhetoric facilitates  violence against racial minorities by framing it in terms of self defense and the protection of the nation from degeneracy, impurity and corruption.
1.1.1.1.1.4.2. Pro: Speech acts that refer to non-white racial groups as [rapists,](http://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-37230916/drug-dealers-criminals-rapists-what-trump-thinks-of-mexicans)[cockroaches](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/katie-hopkins-when-is-enough-enough-10186490.html) or use similarly demagogic language strip members of those groups of their humanity, making violence against them appear more permissible.
1.1.1.1.1.5. Con: The occasional rally and march by the KKK is hardly normalizing white supremacy in the US.
1.1.1.1.1.5.1. Pro: The United States already has a history of White Supremacy which needs to be engaged with. Peaceful public rallies by entities like the KKK make this history harder to erase or forget.
1.1.1.1.1.5.2. Pro: Whenever White supremacists march or protest, it invites challenge and backlash which is often more powerful
1.1.1.1.1.5.2.1. Pro: [Massive counter-protests](http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/19/us/boston-counterprotest-crowd-video-trnd/index.html) in response to a white supremacist march in Boston effectively denounced the actions of the white supremacist march.
1.1.1.1.1.5.2.1.1. Pro: The massive counter-protests in Boston united the people over shared values and opposition to something universally terrible. They were also a way of reassuring and showing support for marginalized peoples.
1.1.1.1.1.5.2.2. Con: It is hard to recognize the backlash as a legitimate action if it turns violent.
1.1.1.1.1.5.2.2.1. Pro: Public backlash is difficult to control and predict, and as such, poses a threat to the safety of participants and bystanders.
1.1.1.1.1.5.2.3. Con: It is often the specific intention of the far right to invite this kind of backlash so as to portray it as violent and disorderly. This allows it to portray itself as the champion of order standing up to the violent and chaotic left.
1.1.1.1.1.5.2.3.1. Pro: [Nazis in Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Themes_in_Nazi_propaganda) used the perceived threat of violence from the left to legitimise themselves leading up to and subsequent to their seizure of power.
1.1.1.1.1.5.2.3.2. Pro: [Mussolini and his fascists](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fascism/2017/01/how_italian_fascists_succeeded_in_taking_over_italy.html) used political violence, often provoked by their own marches, and the general sense that the liberal state had lost control of law and order, to paint themselves as the party of order and legitimise their seizure of power.
1.1.1.1.1.5.3. Pro: In order for language to normalize violence, it must be extremely common and accepted. KKK marches in the status quo are not doing this empirically, however.
1.1.1.1.2. Pro: The Charlottesville protest turned violent, with one demonstrator [killing](http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/13/us/charlottesville-heather-heyer-profile/index.html) a protestor with his car.
1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: The ACLU had sued the city of Charlottesville to allow the Unite the Right rally to happen downtown. This resulted in a death and so associated the ACLU with violence.
1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: The ACLU could not have known in advance that the rally would lead to a death.
1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: The city's reason for the Rally's relocation was that it was trying to prevent confrontation therefore the ACLU was aware of the possibility of violence when they chose to get involved.
1.1.1.1.2.1.1.2. Con: Neo-nazis, white supremacists and similar groups have long histories of violence and terrorism.
1.1.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.
1.1.1.1.2.1.3. Con: The city of Charlottesville [revoked](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/12/16138326/aclu-charlottesville-protests-racism) the rally's permit based on the content of its speech. The ACLU sued to defend free speech.
1.1.1.1.2.1.4. Con: The ACLU is simply defending the right of white supremacists to march, not their actions.
1.1.1.1.2.1.4.1. Con: Given the violent history of rallies and marches by white supermacists, ACLU should've reasonably expected these marches to turn violent. This makes them complicit in enabling and abetting these actions.
1.1.1.1.2.2. Con: The march was [planned](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/09/28/why-we-must-still-defend-free-speech/) as a peaceful protest and the eruption of violence is mainly due to the inability of the local police to handle the protest, break up fights, and keep protesters and counter-protesters separate.
1.1.1.1.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.2.1.4.
1.1.1.1.2.4. Con: There is evidence that man's car [came under attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21FwobI-FI4) prompting him to panic. Keep in mind he has not been convicted of any crime as of July 2018 and the trial is ongoing.
1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Trump's speech has caused a rise in [anti-Muslim](http://www.newsweek.com/trump-speech-anti-muslim-hate-crime-terrorism-study-713905) hate crimes.
1.1.1.2. Pro: There is a distinction between an individual committing a terrorist attack on behalf of an organisation, whether that be ISIS or the KKK, and an individual with racist views committing violent attack acting on their own. In the former situation, those organisations should be held accountable, but in the latter only the individual should.
1.1.2. Pro: Many neo-nazi organizations are literally considered terror groups in many countries, such as the [UK](http://www.jpost.com/International/Britain-to-proscribe-two-more-neo-Nazi-groups-as-terrorist-organizations-506231), and membership is often illegal.
1.1.2.1. Con: If the group is not considered a terrorist organisation by American standards then the ACLU is morally correct in their choice to defend them.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: The CIA defines a [terrorist](http://www.secbrief.org/2014/04/definition-of-terrorism/) organisation as a group which engages in "premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents."
1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: The [attack](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/terrorisms-definition-can-be-applied-to-the-charlottesville-attack) in Charlottesville fits this criteria. It was premeditated, politically motivated and against noncombatant civilians.
1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Many politicians were quick to call the event a [domestic terrorist](https://www.npr.org/2017/08/12/543096579/trump-saw-many-sides-while-some-republicans-saw-white-supremacy-domestic-terrori) attack
1.1.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: There have been a number of politically motivated [violent acts](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/09/killed-hate-victims-america-violence-170924153101480.html) committed against civilians by people connected to white supremacist group in recent times.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Statistically, [a majority of terrorist attacks](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/domestic-terrorism-white-supremacists-islamist-extremists_us_594c46e4e4b0da2c731a84df) in the US are carried out by white supremacists. This suggests that this definition is appropriate in an American context also.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: One of the reasons this is true is because the US has spent over [2 trillion dollars](https://www.thebalance.com/war-on-terror-facts-costs-timeline-3306300) since the 9/11 attacks to destroy Islamic terrorists abroad and stop them from attacking the homeland again.
1.1.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.2.
1.1.3. Con: The ACLU has a new [policy](https://www.vox.com/2017/8/20/16167870/aclu-hate-speech-nazis-charlottesville) of not defending free speech rights of groups that are heavily armed. If white supremacists want to march peacefully, then the ACLU should still defend them.
1.1.4. Pro: White supremacist speech is violent in and of itself.
1.1.4.1. Pro: White supremacist rhetoric implicitly or explicitly calls for the removal of non-White people from society.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: [Richard Spencer](http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/243556/richard-spencer-says-he-just-wants-white-zionism-heres-why-thats-malicious-nonsense), for example, the man who coined the term "alt-right" and has come to represent White nationalism in the US, wants America to be an ethno-state with only White people.
1.1.4.2. Pro: White supremacy often causes severe stress for minorities which can be damaging and harmful to mental health.
1.1.4.2.1. Pro: White supremacy tells minorities that they are worthless and don't belong, which can change how people conceive of their own identity.
1.1.4.2.2. Con: All kinds of speech causes severe stress for different groups of people. Any definition of free speech which did not include these kinds of speech would be far too limiting.
1.1.4.2.2.1. Con: We often ban speech which does these things, including forms of speech which can constitute bullying in schools.
1.1.4.2.3. Pro: This speech can be extremely triggering for minorities who have had traumatic experiences with racism, antisemitism, and other forms of white supremacy.
1.1.4.2.3.1. Con: Discussion about these issues could also be triggering, but that isn't a reason to ban discussion of racism.
1.1.4.2.3.1.1. Con: There is a difference between academic or legal discourse and the rallies conducted by white supremacists.
1.1.4.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: The conditions under which legal or academic discourse is conducted can be controlled to ensure parties feel safe and have equal access to speaking their points of view.
1.1.4.2.3.1.1.2. Pro: Academic discourse on racism often seeks to remedy racial disparities and problems, while speech from white supremacist rallies only serve to exacerbate issues.
1.1.4.2.3.1.1.3. Pro: Academic discourse aims to arrive at some sort of epistemic truth about the world. White Supremacist rallies aim to inflict fear into minority groups.
1.1.4.2.3.1.1.4. Con: It would still be very odd to ban all non-academic and legal discussions of racism. Only a tiny minority of public discussions of racism are academic or legal.
1.1.4.2.3.2. Con: What material triggers people is largely subjective and can't be a coherent standard for when speech is acceptable or not.
1.1.4.2.3.2.1. Pro: Even the staunchest advocates of trigger warnings and safe spaces do not believe that speech that is merely triggering \(as opposed to speech that may also incite violence\) should be banned.
1.1.4.2.3.2.2. Pro: A person with a severe phobia of blood might be triggered by discussion of blood donation. No one thinks discussion of blood donation should be banned.
1.1.4.3. Con: The claim that any speech is violent in and of itself is hyperbole. Most standard understandings of the term "violence" specify acts of physical harm. Therefore speech in and of itself is not violent.
1.1.4.3.1. Con: An understanding of violence reduced to the mere act of physical violence is extremely flawed and incomplete.
1.1.4.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.4.
1.1.4.3.1.2. Pro: Violence is marked by its effect of harm on an individual. We recognize in the 21st century that mental health can often be just as important as physical health for a person's overall well being. Violence inflicted upon the mental self from speech can be just as harmful as physical violence.
1.1.4.3.1.3. Pro: Most people would consider incitement to be violent, therefore, speech can be violent under certain conditions.
1.1.4.4. Con: While speech in and of itself may not be violent, it is clear that speech can and often does provoke socially offensive behavior, both in agreement with and in opposition to the notions expressed in such speech.
1.1.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.4.6. Con: The effort to define certain speech as "violent in of itself" is a tactic to limit freedom of speech. Silencing this speech will not end it. It will merely force it underground and possibly strengthen it. The proper response to speech with which you disagree is dissent, not muzzling.
1.1.5. Pro: The ACLU’s California affiliates issued a [statement](https://www.vox.com/2017/8/20/16167870/aclu-hate-speech-nazis-charlottesville) declaring, We "take the clear position that the First Amendment does not protect people who incite or engage in violence. If white supremacists march into our towns armed to the teeth and with the intent to harm people, they are not engaging in activity protected by the United States Constitution.”
1.1.5.1. Con: It can be inferred from the ACLU's statement that in order for speech to be considered an incitement, there must be "intent." The "tendency" for demonstrators to turn violent is not the same as "intent" and thus, this statement can't support the claim that the "tendency" towards violence causes white supremacists to fall outside of the ACLU's purview.
1.1.5.2. Con: Incitement to violence has very narrowly been [defined by the Supreme Court](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/09/28/why-we-must-still-defend-free-speech/) as not protected only if it is likely to produce imminent lawless action or is a true threat against  a specific individual. Speech advocating violence is protected under the first amendment.
1.1.5.2.1. Pro: It is necessary to have a narrow definition of incitement to violence as to prevent its abuse at the hands of the government in silencing dissenting voices.
1.1.5.2.1.1. Pro: FBI director J. Hoover lead the FBI to [abuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO) the definition of incitement to violence to prosecute civil right groups.
1.1.5.2.1.2. Pro: Between 1917 and 1921, US Attorney General Mitchell Palmer [abused](http://historyproject.uci.edu/files/2016/03/11.4-11.5-HOT-Red_Scare.pdf) the definition of incitement to violence to prosecute civil right and communist groups.
1.1.5.2.1.3. Pro: Senator Joseph McCarthy [used](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/09/28/why-we-must-still-defend-free-speech/) incitement to violence as grounds to punish people associated with communism, socialism, or civil rights groups.
1.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.2.1.
1.1.7. Con: The justification of restricting speech based on the threat of violence is insufficiently specific, since all government action is backed up by the threat of violence.
1.2. Con: Given the current political climate, such a departure from their past would be seen as a partisan move and thus delegitimize the ACLU.
1.2.1. Pro: The ACLU was founded and continues to be a [non-partisan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union) entity.
1.2.1.1. Pro: The ACLU has often taken "conservative" stances on many issues.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: The ACLU defended the Washington [Redskins](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/19/a-history-of-the-aclu-defending-confederate-veterans-the-kkk-and-rush-limbaugh/?utm_term=.4139c69fcbfd) in court when the government threatened to remove their icon.
1.2.1.1.2. Pro: [Ryan Kiesel](https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-oklahoma-issues-statement-ou-fraternity-closure-after-racist-chant-anniversary-selma-march), ACLU of Oklahoma Executive Director urged caution after two students were expelled from the University of Oklahoma for saying offensive racial slurs on video.
1.2.1.1.3. Pro: The head of the ACLU and the Tea Party Patriots [co-wrote an op ed](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/columnists/iowa-view/2015/05/19/aclu-tea-party-agree-urge-government-stop-spying/27627213/) together warning Americans about the Patriot Act.
1.2.1.1.3.1. Con: Opposition to the Patriot act is hardly a conservative position. [Most on the left](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/jun/14/20050614-121304-2787r/) also opposed it.
1.2.1.1.4. Pro: The ACLU has a fairly "conservative" opinion on the [Citizens United](https://www.aclu.org/other/aclu-and-citizens-united) decision.
1.2.1.1.5. Con: Even though it does take conservative stances on some issues, [many](https://townhall.com/columnists/mattbarber/2011/03/25/aclu-communism-is-the-goal-n1167720) [conservatives](http://historyhalf.com/the-real-history-of-the-aclu/) still view the ALCU as a primarily liberal, even Marxist, organisation.
1.2.2. Pro: For decades, the ACLU has [defended](http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/16/politics/aclu-free-speech-white-supremacy/index.html) KKK members and neo-Nazis. It is unlikely that this will be a death knell to the ACLU.
1.2.3. Pro: The [mission statement](https://www.aclu.org/faqs#1_1) of the ACLU is to preserve the individual rights and liberties guaranteed to all people in this country by the Constitution and laws of the United States. This includes everyone from Nazis to Civil Rights leaders.
1.2.4. Con: The ACLU is largely already viewed as an extremely liberal organization.
1.2.4.1. Pro: There is a wide belief that the ACLU since its founding has been [communist](https://www.aclu.org/faqs#3_4) and [anti-American](http://dailycaller.com/2011/01/04/the-aclu%E2%80%99s-untold-stalinist-heritage/) at heart.
1.2.4.2. Pro: The Right is not going to suddenly start liking the ACLU because they defend Nazis. They will pilloried as a liberal shibboleth no matter who they defend, because the Right's strategy is to attack non-partisan groups in an effort to supplant them with conservative ones.
1.2.4.2.1. Pro: Organizations such as the [ACLJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Center_for_Law_%26_Justice) have been formed as right-leaning alternatives to the ACLU.
1.2.4.2.2. Pro: The Right has attacked non-partisan news sources or exaggerated claims of partisanship to supplant them with right leaning sources such as Fox and Breitbart.
1.2.4.3. Pro: The ACLU is already viewed as treasonous by many on the right for defending the likes of Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning.
1.2.4.4. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.2.4.5. Pro: Stories,[such as how an ACLU board member in Colorado asked his supporters to kill Trump](http://denver.cbslocal.com/2015/12/11/aclu-board-member-resigns-after-urging-people-to-kill-supporters-of-trump/), have had an impact on the views of Trump supporters and Republicans.
1.2.4.6. Pro: The ACLU's vocal objections to many of President Trump's policies have caused people to view the ACLU as a partisan organization.
1.2.4.6.1. Pro: According to the [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/issues/national-security/donald-trump-one-man-constitutional-crisis), Trump's positions on immigration violate multiple parts of the Bill of Rights.
1.2.4.6.2. Pro: The Trump administration has pursued numerous grossly unconstitutional and rights violative policies.
1.2.4.6.2.1. Pro: The Muslim ban, for example, is a clearly targeted effort to try to ban a group of individuals from the United States on the basis of their faith.
1.2.4.6.2.2. Pro: Trump wants to conduct [unconstitutional](https://www.aclu.org/issues/national-security/donald-trump-one-man-constitutional-crisis) and illegal surveillance on Muslim communities throughout the US.
1.2.4.6.2.3. Pro: Trump's position on [torture](https://www.aclu.org/issues/national-security/donald-trump-one-man-constitutional-crisis) violates 2 international conventions, 2 constitutional amendments, and 6 domestic laws.
1.2.4.6.2.4. Pro: The Trump administration has revoked press credentials for news organizations which it doesn't like such as the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/trump-revokes-post-press-credentials-calling-the-paper-dishonest-and-phony/2016/06/13/f9a61a72-31aa-11e6-95c0-2a6873031302_story.html?utm_term=.2a7c94943abf), [Univision](http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/14/media/donald-trump-media-blacklist/index.html), and Politico.
1.2.4.6.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.6.1.
1.2.4.6.3. Pro: The ACLU regularly and frequently posts on social media trashing President Trump.
1.2.5. Con: The ACLU [claims to be](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union) a non-partisan entity that is [widely regarded](http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-aclu-profile-20170131-story.html) to have liberal tendencies. If anything, endorsing white supremacists would be a move that would strengthen their commitment to ["defend and preserve the Constitution’s promise of liberty for everyone in our country."](https://www.aclu.org/)
1.2.5.1. Con: Defending white supremacists is not an endorsement of their ideology, this is the whole point behind the free speech work the ACLU does.
1.2.5.1.1. Pro: By defending everyone, you can claim "We're neutral" and "We may not agree with what they say but we will defend the right to say it". A lawyer doesn't endorse his client's actions, even if he continues to defend a guilty man being strapped into the electric chair.
1.2.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.2.
1.2.5.3. Con: Rather, picking to defend only views that agree with their own would undermine the ACLU's non-partisan advocacy, and its position. It is difficult to to ask others to tolerate speech they oppose while equally only choosing to defend speech with which you agree.
1.2.5.4. Con: The ACLU's commitment to defend and preserve the Constitution's promise of liberty for everyone in our country extends to White Supremacists' right to free speech.
1.2.6. Pro: The ACLU is likely to lose members to more conservative organizations.
1.2.6.1. Pro: This contributes a terrible trend of Balkaninzation, the splitting apart of non-partisan institutions, such as the press, into partisan organizations catering to sections of the populace.
1.2.6.2. Con: If the ACLU stands up against oppressive uses of free speech, they're more likely to receive an increase in progressive members.
1.2.6.2.1. Con: Conversely, if the ACLU  are seen to be betraying their core belief in free speech and its protection, they are likely to lose members and donors from all over the political spectrum.
1.2.6.2.1.1. Pro: A majority of Americans oppose [banning hate speech](https://www.cato.org/survey-reports/state-free-speech-tolerance-america), and a majority across all demographic agree that free speech ensures the truth will also win out. This indicates the ACLU could lose a lot of support by failing to protect free speech, even that of Nazis.
1.2.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.2.1.
1.3. Pro: The current white supremacist movement has reached a level of power and influence that makes it no longer acceptable to support in any form, even a principled one.
1.3.1. Pro: The Trump Presidency has normalized the alt-right, including figures such as Richard Spencer. The demonstrations in Charlottesville are evidence that these groups feel they can march in the streets in large numbers.
1.3.1.1. Pro: This is [supported](http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2017/08/15/richard-spencer-david-duke-tweets-praise-trump-erin-sot.cnn) by David Duke and Richard Spencer publicly thanking Donald Trump for his support of their causes.
1.3.1.2. Pro: The inclusion of alt-right figures in Trump's administration such as Steve Bannon, Stephen Miller, and Sebastian Gorka gave the movement a mainstream appeal and national platform.
1.3.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.3.
1.3.1.4. Pro: The rhetoric of the Trump administration has, in many ways, fit thematically with the core message of the alt-right. That the United States is in some sort of decline caused by immigration, advocacy by minorities, and trade with foreigners.
1.3.1.4.1. Pro: Donald Trump's Chief Strategist Steve Bannon ran Breitbart, a website he dubbed "[the platform for the alt-right.](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/08/14/donald_trump_s_ties_to_alt_right_white_supremacists_are_extensive.html)"
1.3.2. Con: This argument is based on the premise that at one time, the white supremacist movement was acceptable, not due to any change in rhetoric or belief, but because of their level of power and influence.
1.3.2.1. Pro: It could be argued that the white supremacist movement enjoyed more overt power prior to the civil rights movement than they currently hold.
1.3.3. Con: A group's power or influence has no bearing on whether or not Constitutionally-defined rights apply to them.
1.3.3.1. Con: If the speech of a group infringes on someone else's rights and [shows intent to violence](http://www.theblaze.com/contributions/the-1st-amendment-is-not-absolute), then their influence holds some bearings as it is a dangerous act to spread such hate speech so effectively.
1.3.3.2. Con: This may be true, but that does not mean the ACLU should spend valuable resources defending white supremacists when other individuals have their rights being taken away.
1.3.3.2.1. Pro: White supremacists uniquely deserve their rights protected the least of all groups. This doesn't mean they don't have them, just that everyone else should be prioritized.
1.3.3.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.2.1.1.2.
1.3.3.2.1.2. Pro: Believing in the human dignity of people and other basic tenets of decency are a necessary precondition to having views respected.
1.3.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: Democracy at its core is people voting based on their belief systems and what they think is in their best interests and the best interest of their community and society. This process requires discourse and the debating of ideas.
1.3.3.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: Jurgen Habermas' [Discourse Principle](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/habermas/#HabDisTheMorPolLaw) argues that a rule of action or choice is justified, and thus valid, only if all those affected by the rule or choice could accept it in a reasonable discourse. This points to the need for all speech to be considered in the making of political decisions.
1.3.3.2.1.2.2. Pro: Undemocratic views threaten the existence of democracy, which is a prerequisite to having free discourse in the first place. Believing in democracy should be a requirement to be part of popular discourse in one.
1.3.3.2.1.2.2.1. Con: A democracy cannot be fully functional without opinion and insight from all sectors of society.
1.3.3.2.1.2.2.1.1. Con: A democracy cannot be fully functional, if the practice of some beliefs are oppressive towards other members of that society.
1.3.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Historically, the ideology and practices of Neo-Nazis, White Supremacists and similar groups have only led to oppression and fear, as opposed to creating a safe environment for all citizens. These organizations have long histories of violence and terrorism.
1.3.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.
1.3.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: The KKK and other hate groups are responsible for countless murders, beatings, lynchings and attacks on civil liberties in the country. Defending them only enables them to continue this sort of violence.
1.3.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.3. Pro: Neo Nazis actively try to silence minorities.
1.3.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: Their platform advocates for [citizenship](http://www.americannaziparty.com/platform/index.php) to be granted only to Aryan people, effectively disenfranchising minorities.
1.3.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.3.2. Pro: The political group aims to [reestablish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism) the Third Reich, or Hitler's government, under which minorities were systematically silenced and killed.
1.3.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.3.3. Pro: Neo Nazis protesters actively [express](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/16/charlottesville-neo-nazis-vice-news-hbo) violence and seek to cause fear and intimidation in minorities, preventing them from speaking up.
1.3.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.3.3.1. Pro: Individuals, here minorities, cannot exercise their right of free speech when faced with violence.
1.3.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.4. Pro: The Klan’s [campaign](https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/Ku-Klux-Klan-A-History-of-Racism.pdf) of terror against the civil rights movement in the 1960's resulted in almost 70 bombings in Georgia and Alabama, the arson of 30 black churches in Mississippi, and 10 racial killings in Alabama alone.
1.3.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.5. Pro: The Klan's [origins](https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/Ku-Klux-Klan-A-History-of-Racism.pdf) were as a fraternal organization that quickly became a form of armed insurrection against Reconstruction governments in the aftermath of the Civil War.
1.3.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.6. Con: Hate speech [is protected](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-white-first-amendment-slogans-20170608-story.html) under the first amendment.
1.3.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.6.1. Pro: White Supremacists have equal protection under the first amendment as anyone else.
1.3.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.6.2. Con: The constitution should not be a moral compass. It was written by literal white supremacists.
1.3.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.6.2.1. Pro: [Thomas Jefferson](http://xroads.virginia.edu/~hyper/jefferson/ch14.html) argued that African-Americans could not exist alongside whites in mainstream society.
1.3.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.6.3. Con: The constitution is an antiquated and racist document.
1.3.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.6.3.1. Pro: Article I of the Constitution says slaves are three-fifths of a person, and Article IV requires states to return runaway slaves.
1.3.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.6.3.1.1. Con: The 3/5th Compromise was done specifically to limit the power of White slaveowners. Since Black people couldn't vote, counting them as citizens would have given White slaveowners disproportionate power in the House of Representatives.
1.3.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.6.3.1.1.1. Con: Regardless of the intentions behind a particular constitutional provision, the fact that this one defined a significant portion of the population as less than human is still proof of the fact that the constitution is a racist document.
1.3.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.6.4. Con: There are already a number of [exceptions](http://www.newseuminstitute.org/about/faq/which-types-of-speech-are-not-protected-by-the-first-amendment/) to the 1st Amendment. This demonstrates that it is not all-encompassing of all speech and can be changed to suit the needs of the people.
1.3.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.6.4.1. Pro: These exceptions have been created over time and so it stands to reason that more exceptions will be created as the need arises. These exceptions make the right to freedom of speech a limited right.
1.3.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.6.4.2. Con: The Supreme Court have had cases in the past which question whether hate speech should be allowed under the freedom of speech. Past precedence therefore shows that it is unlikely that it will become an exception in the future.
1.3.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.6.4.3. Pro: Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story [stated](https://www.mercatornet.com/features/view/socratic-reason-free-speech-and-white-supremacists/20524) to read the first amendment’s free speech as “intended to secure every citizen an absolute right to speak, or write, or print, whatever he might please, without any responsibility, public or private, therefor, is a supposition too wild to be indulged by any rational man.”
1.3.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.6.4.4. Pro: Some of the exceptions include defamation, fraud and incitement. When white supremacists shout "Mexicans are rapists" in public they defame an entire people and can incite violence on the part of those listening, and wishing to defend their name.
1.3.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.7. Con: The need for speech creating a safe environment for all citizens is not a prerequisite for it to be protected.
1.3.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.8. Con: Much of what the Civil Rights Movement did \(sit-ins, marches\) made people uncomfortable, and if not for free speech protections, would have been banned.
1.3.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.8.1. Con: This does not mean that the ACLU should protect the free speech rights of the KKK. Simply that they should exercise reasonable judgement and protect civil rights advocates.
1.3.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.8.1.1. Con: If the KKK and similar organizations were to adopt the same strategies of delivering their message as civil rights activists, the ACLU has an obligation to ensure that they are protected equally.
1.3.3.2.1.2.2.2. Con: Denying a certain group of people the right to their beliefs is undemocratic at its core.
1.3.3.2.1.2.2.2.1. Pro: A democratic society is based on the idea that all of its members are equals. By denying the right to hold certain beliefs, society is saying that the members who hold those beliefs, are less worthy.
1.3.3.2.1.2.2.3. Pro: [The paradox of tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance) states that if a society is tolerant without limit then it leaves society vulnerable to being taken over by the intolerant, meaning that society would no longer be tolerant at all. The conclusion of this is that sometimes it is necessary to be intolerant in order to protect overall tolerance of society in general.
1.3.3.2.1.3. Pro: White Supremacists [often](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2017/08/14/jews-will-not-replace-us-why-white-supremacists-go-after-jews/) display Nazi imagery and yell Nazi chants, valorizing a group responsible for the systematic extermination of Jews in the holocaust among other atrocities.
1.3.3.2.1.4. Pro: The ideas promoted by white supremacists are false.
1.3.3.2.1.4.1. Pro: The idea of a superior White race is scientifically false.
1.3.3.2.1.4.1.1. Pro: There are [no genetic differences](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/race-is-not-biological_us_56b8db83e4b04f9b57da89ed) between races.
1.3.3.2.1.4.1.2. Pro: White Supremacists often advance [flawed or bogus](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/5/18/15655638/charles-murray-race-iq-sam-harris-science-free-speech)    studies as evidence for a difference in the intelligence between races.
1.3.3.2.1.4.1.3. Pro: Race is a [social construct](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/race-is-a-social-construct-scientists-argue/) and ultimately weak proxies for genetic diversity. Basing an ideology around race is thus not scientifically sound.
1.3.3.2.1.4.2. Con: The ACLU is not competent to determine whether or not an idea or set of ideas is false. Their purpose and mission is merely to ensure that all ideas can be spoken and heard.
1.3.3.2.1.4.2.1. Pro: A lot of speech and a lot of opinions are probably false, but the purpose of a marketplace of ideas is to allow people to determine that for themselves.
1.3.3.2.1.4.2.2. Con: This assumes that there is a market place of ideas in which the 'best' idea will always win out. In reality, public discourse is distorted by a number of factors that makes this outcome less likely on the question of bigoted and racist speech.
1.3.3.2.1.4.2.2.1. Pro: Most racists benefit materially from white supremacy and see it as the natural order of things. This means it is especially difficult to persuade them through rational debate.
1.3.3.2.1.4.2.2.2. Pro: Anti-racism and white supremacy are based on two fundamentally opposed axioms that cannot be reconciled with each other. Rational debate can only function properly if there is a shared axiom on which the debate is based, otherwise participants are effectively arguing with each other in different languages, and as such nobody is likely to be persuaded of anything.
1.3.3.2.1.4.2.2.3. Pro: If it is the case that open discourse will not be successful in changing the minds of racists and white supremacists, then attempting to limit and control the exposure of their ideas is a legitimate strategy.
1.3.3.2.1.4.2.2.4. Con: [One man](https://www.npr.org/2017/08/20/544861933/how-one-man-convinced-200-ku-klux-klan-members-to-give-up-their-robes) was able to compel 200 Klansman to take off their robes, simply by engaging with them and being friendly. When people engage openly, they are more likely to have their supremacist views challenged in an effective way.
1.3.3.2.1.4.2.2.5. Pro: Public discourse or conversations are often mediated by the media, which can distort or perverse the arguments.
1.3.3.2.1.4.2.2.5.1. Pro: Despite the mostly peaceful "Rally Against Hate" protest in Berkeley, the media [focused](https://www.thenation.com/article/why-berkeleys-battle-against-white-supremacy-is-not-about-free-speech/) on a few violent instances, painting Berkeley as a hotbed of far-left extremism.
1.3.3.2.1.4.2.2.5.2. Pro: Milo Yiannopoulos [misrepresented](http://www.davisvanguard.org/2017/01/view-alternative-explanation-milo-taking-shape/) facts and lied to the press after the cancellation of his speech at UC Davis in order to create the narrative that his speech was cancelled in violation of the College Republicans' First Amendment rights.
1.3.3.2.1.4.2.2.5.3. Pro: The cancellation of Yiannopolos' speech at the University of California Berkeley was depicted as an attack on White's free speech by [Breitbart](http://www.breitbart.com/milo/2017/02/01/milo-true-heir-berkeley-free-speech-movement/), despite the real reason being security [concerns.](https://www.thenation.com/article/why-berkeleys-battle-against-white-supremacy-is-not-about-free-speech/)
1.3.3.2.1.4.2.2.5.3.1. Pro: Yiannopoulos planned to [publicly out undocumented students](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/uc-berkely-protests-milo-yiannopoulos-publicly-name-undocumented-students-cancelled-talk-illegals-a7561321.html) at Berkeley, an act that could well have put them in danger.
1.3.3.2.1.4.2.2.5.4. Pro: Free speech on campus is often depicted as being under threat from the left, yet the fact that the right has actually done [far more](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Political-Correctness-Has-Run/242143) to erode free speech in universities tends to be ignored by the media.
1.3.3.2.1.4.3. Con: Aside from theories of genetic superiority, most white supremacist positions are political propositions. These are not statements of fact that can be determined true or false in a conventional sense, but are rather systems of belief that cannot really be 'proved' one way or the other.
1.3.3.2.1.4.3.1. Pro: The statement 'white culture is superior to other culture' is not one that can be assessed with any kind of objective metric. It is something that rather comes down to subjective value judgements and intuitions. One can think that it is a reprehensible position to hold, but it does not really make sense to describe it as 'false' \(or true for that matter\).
1.3.3.2.1.5. Pro: Native American cries for help have largely fallen on deaf ears in courts and the Congress. The ACLU would be better off trying to protect the rights of extremely marginalized groups.
1.3.3.2.1.6. Con: Human rights are "human" rights because they belong to everyone. The ACLU should not shy away from protecting them when it is inconvenient.
1.3.4. Pro: Providing legal defenses for White Supremacists empowers the movement.
1.3.4.1. Pro: It allows White Supremacists to hold rallies, attracting media coverage and invigorating the movement.
1.3.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.2.1.3.
1.3.4.2. Pro: Defending the movement depicts White Supremacists as a marginalized group needing protection from the government, playing into the narrative that White America is under attack.
1.3.4.2.1. Pro: 55% of White Americans believe that whites experience racial discrimination \([Discrimination in America: Experiences and Views of White Americans 1](https://www.rwjf.org/content/dam/farm/reports/surveys_and_polls/2017/rwjf441554)\)
1.3.4.2.2. Pro: White Americans increasingly [view](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/05/22/is-anti-white-bias-a-problem/jockeying-for-stigma) racism against blacks as solved and believe that anti-white bias is on the rise.
1.3.4.2.3. Pro: It promotes the idea that the Freedom of Speech of whites is under attack.
1.3.4.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.2.1.4.2.2.5.3.
1.3.5. Pro: Defending White Supremacists risks their ideology becoming mainstream or acted upon.
1.3.5.1. Pro: The recent rise in anti Muslim, anti immigrant, and anti LGBTQ rhetoric has been [correlated](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-rise-of-hate-crimes-can-be-tied-directly-to-hateful-speech) with an increase in violence towards these groups.
1.3.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.
1.3.5.3. Con: A balance can be found between defending a White Supremacist's ideology and simultaneously keeping the negative sides to the beliefs known too. The ACLU stand to allow them to share their beliefs but not to aid in justifying them.
1.3.6. Pro: Other organizations have withdrawn their support from White Supremacists.
1.3.6.1. Pro: Many companies have severed ties with White Nationalists.
1.3.6.1.1. Pro: GoDaddy and Google have both [dropped](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/08/14/godaddy-bans-neo-nazi-site-daily-stormer-for-disparaging-woman-killed-at-charlottesville-rally/?utm_term=.f8e0bccf9ea4) neo-Nazi site the Daily Stormer's domain name.
1.3.6.1.2. Pro: Apple Pay, Cloudflare, and PayPal have all [banned](http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-apple-cloudflare-nazis-20170817-story.html) the use of their services with sites associated with White Supremacy.
1.3.6.1.3. Pro: Spotify has [removed](http://www.elle.com/culture/tech/news/a47459/a-bunch-of-companies-are-cutting-service-from-white-supremacists/) a number of White Supremacist bands.
1.3.6.1.4. Pro: Squarespace has [dropped](http://www.elle.com/culture/tech/news/a47459/a-bunch-of-companies-are-cutting-service-from-white-supremacists/) a number of prominent White Supremacist sites from their service.
1.3.6.1.5. Pro: Uber has [banned](http://www.elle.com/culture/tech/news/a47459/a-bunch-of-companies-are-cutting-service-from-white-supremacists/) two prominent White Supremacists.
1.3.6.2. Con: The ACLU is different to other organisations because the entire purpose of its existence is to defend constitutional civil liberties, among those being the right to freedom of speech.
1.3.6.3. Con: Plenty of other organisations have not withdrawn support. Given that different companies take different stances on cutting ties, it would clearly be morally incoherent for the ACLU to base its actions on what companies in general have done.
1.3.6.4. Con: Many of these organizations had profit incentives in cutting ties with White Supremacists. It's bad business to be seen as profiting from purchases or transactions involving these kinds of individuals.
1.3.7. Con: The ACLU does not 'support' the  ideals of the white supremacist movement.
1.3.7.1. Pro: The ACLU exists to protect rights, not to judge the exercise of those rights, and has defended White Supremacy groups for decades to that end.
1.3.7.1.1. Pro: Having a group that works to check government overreach in all its forms is incredibly valuable to society.
1.3.7.1.1.1. Pro: An independent group devoted to this means that acts of either political party will receive the same scrutiny.
1.3.7.1.1.1.1. Con: The ACLU can scrutinize both major parties and refuse to defend white supremacists.
1.3.7.1.1.2. Pro: The Bill of Rights was created to protect individuals from government overreach.
1.3.7.1.1.3. Pro: Governments are likely to care most about groups that have the most political capital, meaning their abuses are likely to hurt those least capable of holding them electorally accountable. The ACLU defends those people.
1.3.7.1.1.3.1. Con: Given that the ACLU itself depends on donations to run, its agenda is just as prone to capture by vested interests as the government's is.
1.3.7.1.1.3.1.1. Con: People who donate to the ACLU are likely to be people who believe in the ACLU's principles, and thus are at least comparatively less likely to attempt to co-opt their agenda than political donors.
1.3.7.1.2. Pro: If you do not support your principles when they are challenged, they are not principles, they are hobbies.
1.3.7.1.2.1. Con: It is absolutely reasonable to have limits on your principles. In many cases, not placing limits on your principles leads to disastrous results.
1.3.7.1.2.1.1. Pro: We place restrictions on principles all the time when they come into contact with other principles. For instance, we do not permit freedom of speech when such speech is used to defame another.
1.3.7.1.2.2. Con: The right action to take is one that is the mean of two conflicting extremes. A principle is an extreme while virtuous actions must be subject to flexibility based on the context.
1.3.7.1.2.2.1. Pro: A quest for happiness and the good life drives most human action. Virtues, those actions between deficiency and excess, are empirically the best way for humans to do this.
1.3.7.1.2.2.2. Con: This principle collapses into self-contradiction. Arguing that the right action is always one that is the mean of two conflicting extremes is itself an absolute and extreme position.
1.3.7.1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.2.1.6.
1.3.7.1.3. Pro: The ACLU does not create or grant speech rights, it simply helps secure rights that others already possess. In order for them to have a reason to not defend the free speech of right supremacists we would have to look at what rights the law already gives them and change that.
1.3.7.1.3.1. Con: The ACLU [has already changed its policy](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/charlottesville-violence-prompts-aclu-change-policy-hate-groups-protesting-guns) with regard to when they are willing to defend white supremacist groups without any change in law occurring.
1.3.7.1.3.1.1. Con: Attaching conditionality to their defense of a particular group is a far less drastic step than revoking all defense from that group. The latter is something the ACLU has never done.
1.3.7.1.3.1.2. Pro: The ACLU can have a separate but equally legitimate interpretation of the first amendment from the government. The ACLU is not somehow bound by US case law to believe certain interpretations of constitutional law.
1.3.7.1.3.2. Con: It is legitimate for the ACLU to use discretion and refuse to simply defend individuals with blind regard to any context.
1.3.7.1.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.1.3.1.2.
1.3.7.1.4. Pro: Freedom of Speech is one of the ACLU's critical, founding principles.
1.3.7.1.5. Con: The ACLU has to prioritize whose rights to protect due to limitations on their resources. At this point, they ought to defend people who are not racists.
1.3.7.1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.2.1.
1.3.7.1.5.2. Con: The speech that actually needs to be protected is shocking speech that makes people feel uncomfortable. Speech which doesn't do that is very rarely under threat. It is therefore entirely appropriate that ACLU devotes at least some of its resources to protecting this kind of speech.
1.3.7.1.6. Con: The ACLU frequently objects when one person's exercise of a right infringes on the rights of another. White supremacy demonstrations infringe on other people's rights to feel safe and not be persecuted.
1.3.7.1.6.1. Con: Feeling safe and not persecuted are subjective and generally considered to not be overarching rights.
1.3.7.1.6.1.1. Pro: These are feelings, subject to incredible subjectivity. Allowed to be priorities, they would subsume other critical rights such as free speech.
1.3.7.1.6.1.1.1. Con: There is nothing inherently or objectively 'good' about free speech.
1.3.7.1.6.1.1.1.1. Pro: Similar to many rights, the "goodness" of the right is contingent on how it is exercised.
1.3.7.1.6.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Generally, we believe that people are allowed to exercise their rights to the extent that they do not interfere with another's rights. Thus, the way in which a right is exercised clearly matters.
1.3.7.1.6.1.1.1.2. Con: There are some rights that people ought have the freedom to exercise at their discretion irrespective of the broader good it does to the rest of society, speech is one of them.
1.3.7.1.6.1.1.1.3. Pro: Speech is only valuable insofar as it benefits society. Hate speech definitionally detracts from society.
1.3.7.1.6.1.2. Pro: Free speech is always going to make some people feel less safe. This is a price we pay for our freedom of expression.
1.3.7.1.6.1.2.1. Con: We also take into account the degree to which this discomfort is felt. The speech and action of white supremacist groups undermine the rights of an already vulnerable minority far more than any other freedoms of expression.
1.3.7.1.6.1.3. Pro: People shouldn't be subject to fear and persecution generally, however these are not constitutionally protected in the way free speech is. The ACLU strongly believes in constitutional protections and defends those rights in particular.
1.3.7.1.6.1.3.1. Con: Freedom from persecution is a critical part of the US Constitution. There is a very clear norm that people should not be unfairly subject to hostility.
1.3.7.1.6.1.3.1.1. Pro: The 1st Amendment prohibits government discrimination against religion and allows people to express their views.
1.3.7.1.6.1.3.1.2. Pro: The 4th Amendment prohibits unreasonable search and seizure, a requirement based on the idea that people deserve to be treated fairly.
1.3.7.1.6.1.3.1.3. Pro: The 5th Amendment ensure due process rights, which require people to be treated fairly under the law.
1.3.7.1.6.1.3.1.4. Pro: The 6th Amendment affords the right to a trial by jury, which helps to ensure people are not capriciously persecuted by agents of the state.
1.3.7.1.6.1.3.1.5. Pro: The 8th Amendment prohibits cruel and unusual punishment, another right based on the principle of not being abused.
1.3.7.1.6.1.3.1.6. Pro: The 13th Amendment abolishes slavery, which by definition in the US was racial persecution.
1.3.7.1.6.1.3.1.7. Pro: The 14th Amendment ensures equal protection under the law for all people.
1.3.7.1.6.1.3.1.8. Pro: The 15th Amendment prohibits the denial of the right to vote based on race, which is based on the idea that people ought not be persecuted.
1.3.7.1.6.1.3.1.9. Pro: The 19th Amendment grants women the right to vote. This was done based on the idea that it was unfair that women could not vote.
1.3.7.1.6.1.3.1.10. Pro: The 24th Amendment prohibits poll taxes and other measures aimed at de facto barring Black people from voting. This is another step towards eliminating unfair hostility.
1.3.7.1.6.1.3.1.11. Con: These amendments guarantee freedom from persecution in particular and narrowly tailored ways. They do not constitute some broad broad right which extends to speech.
1.3.7.1.6.1.3.1.11.1. Pro: More specifically, the "freedom from persecution" that was guaranteed was freedom from "government" persecution.  

Specifically, people should be free to speak their minds without the fear of being arrested for saying something outside the government's narrative, such as is happening in places like China or North Korea.
1.3.7.1.6.1.4. Con: -> See 1.3.7.1.6.1.3.1.
1.3.7.1.6.1.5. Con: Because these feelings are so subjective, authority on the subjects should go to the people who experience these feelings on a day to day basis, rather than trying to legislate what most people have never even experienced.
1.3.7.1.6.1.5.1. Con: This is clearly unsustainable as a generalised principle or policy. Many conservatives undeniably feel persecuted for their beliefs from their subjective point of view, but it would be clearly absurd to defer authority to them over whether or not they have a right to not be 'persecuted' by liberals.
1.3.7.1.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.
1.3.7.1.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.
1.3.7.1.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.2.
1.3.7.1.6.5. Con: When weighing rights against one another, non violent demonstrations do not infringe on other's rights enough for them to be dismissed by the ACLU as illegitimate.
1.3.7.1.6.5.1. Pro: Speech, in the absence of action, is not an active threat to the people to which it is directed.
1.3.7.1.6.5.1.1. Pro: In the vast majority of cases it is easy for the minority in question to avoid interacting with the speech of white supremacists.
1.3.7.1.6.5.1.1.1. Pro: A person that does not align with White Supremacist ideology or feels threatened by it can just not go to a rally organized by them, avoid or blacklist their websites online and not interact with them on social media.
1.3.7.1.6.5.1.2. Con: Threats do not need to be active or violent to be harmful - the speech of white supremacists can create a culture of fear and uncomfortable living spaces for those who are oppressed by their beliefs.
1.3.7.1.6.5.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.4.2.3.
1.3.7.1.6.6. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.6.
1.3.7.1.6.7. Pro: White supremacist speech acts hinder the ability of racial minorities to participate in public discourse.
1.3.7.1.6.7.1. Pro: If the discursive environment is one in which minority identities are routinely attacked, condemned and dehumanised, then much fewer people of those identities will be willing to participate in that environment.
1.3.7.1.6.7.1.1. Pro: This is especially true for African-Americans interacting with white supremacy. Many may see Confederate flags and statues of Confederate generals as expressions of free speech, but in the context of the South they were used during the Jim Crow era as a reminder of who was in charge and the consequences of speaking out. This kinds of speech therefore creates a chilling effect on minority speech.
1.3.7.1.6.7.1.1.1. Pro: Confederate monuments were built during the [Civil Rights Era](http://theweek.com/speedreads/718507/striking-graphic-reveals-construction-confederate-monuments-peaked-during-jim-crow-civil-rights-eras) specifically to send that message.
1.3.7.1.6.7.2. Pro: Even if speech is free in a legalistic sense, it is not free in a material sense because the ability of many minorities to actually safely access their right to speech is massively hindered.
1.3.7.1.6.7.2.1. Pro: As [hate speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech) incites violence or prejudicial action against certain groups, it generates fear that words of hate might inspire acts of hate.
1.3.7.1.6.7.2.2. Pro: The history of racism and slavery in the US makes the rise of White supermacist speech acts lead to dread that it might return.
1.3.7.1.6.7.2.2.1. Pro: [Jim Crow laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws) were state and local laws that enforced racial segregation in the Southern United States and were used to [oppress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws#Racism_in_the_United_States_and_defenses_of_Jim_Crow) African Americans.
1.3.7.1.6.7.2.2.2. Pro: Symbols of the Confederacy, such as the [Confederate flag](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history/2015/07/confederate_flag_it_s_not_a_symbol_of_southern_heritage_it_has_always_been.html) and confederate monuments, were intended to symbolize white supremacy and racial oppression.
1.3.7.1.6.7.2.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.1.6.7.1.1.1.
1.3.7.1.6.7.2.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.
1.3.7.1.6.7.3. Con: Because racist hate speech is such a taboo that the majority of people condemns it whenever it occurs, racial minorities receive sufficient support to not significantly be hindered in their ability to engage in public discussions.
1.3.7.1.6.7.3.1. Con: The rising presence of speech that targets minorities is enough to make them feel unsafe and threatened, regardless of the support that they receive from the rest of the population.
1.3.7.1.6.7.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.1.6.7.2.1.
1.3.7.1.6.7.3.2. Con: Explicit racist hate speech may be condemned by the majority, but the existence of [dog whistle politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog-whistle_politics) enables white supremacists to code their speech in such a way that most of it will never receive this condemnation.
1.3.7.1.6.7.3.2.1. Pro: Many people are more likely to defend speeches of white supremacists on the basis of not considering it to be hate speech.
1.3.7.1.6.7.3.2.2. Con: The biggest and most powerful groups; the groups that are publicly known as white supremacists, such as the [Alt-right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-right#Reactions) movement, receive plenty of public condemnation from people on both sides of the political spectrum.
1.3.7.1.6.8. Pro: Minority groups already have an unequal access to rights, and thus extra care should be placed into ensuring equal access to rights.
1.3.7.1.6.8.1. Pro: Minorities are the targets for systemic racism.
1.3.7.1.6.8.1.1. Pro: Majority black riots in Ferguson received [disproportionately](http://www.stltoday.com/news/criticisms-and-lessons-from-the-doj-report-on-ferguson-response/collection_80bc8b44-b962-55cd-89b5-fba028d2fa11.html) heavy handed and militarized police responses.
1.3.7.1.6.8.2. Pro: Minorities have [on average](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/09/28/black-and-hispanic-families-are-making-more-money-but-they-still-lag-far-behind-whites/?utm_term=.b37262a4a334) a lot less wealth, and thus less access to speech.
1.3.7.1.6.8.2.1. Pro: Money [is](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/geoffrey-r-stone/is-money-speech_b_1255787.html) a form a speech in the sense that those with money can be used to lobby politicians, contribute to political campaigns, and buy airtime and commercialism.
1.3.7.1.6.9. Con: Marginalized communities have access to legal representation from groups like the ACLU. The only way to contribute to the divide in access is to deny this to some groups and not to others.
1.3.7.1.6.9.1. Con: This does not account for imbalance of power within the court system. Non-marginalized groups tend to be the judges and fill the juries. They are also not mischaracterized in the courts by harmful stereotypes. The ACLU tries to correct for the power imbalance by mostly representing the rights of marginalized groups.
1.3.8. Con: The only way to get rid of bigoted speech is to allow it to air. If you force it underground there is less awareness of the threat and debates against it.
1.3.8.1. Con: These views get proliferated through far-right news sources and blogs, meaning that when Nazis and white supremacists organize, their ideology gets picked up by others.
1.3.8.1.1. Con: Anti-Nazi groups and movements have risen in popularity in response to Nazi-esque demonstrations in public. When the movement was still restricted to the internet, few people knew enough of the treat they posed to actively oppose them. Thus, public airing allows people to recognize the importance of opposing these ideas.
1.3.8.1.1.1. Pro: Antifa has risen up and gained a national profile, largely in response to marches by white supremacists and other groups.
1.3.8.1.1.2. Con: Previous ACLU defences of hateful right-wing speakers have never enabled or preceded a spike in political power for American Nazis or members of the Ku Klux Klan.
1.3.8.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.5.2.1.
1.3.8.2. Con: When hate speech is aired publicly, it can become normalized and mainstream. The [Overton window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window), the range of ideas tolerated in public discourse, can shift easily
1.3.8.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.
1.3.8.2.2. Pro: People feel validated in their views, whether they are right or wrong, when those views are held by other people. Airing hate speech encourages those who have the potential to engage in bigotry.
1.3.8.2.3. Pro: A [study](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ab.21737/full) from Poland finds exposure to angry, hostile content targeting specific groups indirectly increases people's prejudices.
1.3.8.2.4. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.5.
1.3.8.2.5. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.5.2.
1.3.8.2.6. Pro: When White Supremacists march on the streets, then more moderate, subtle forms of racism seem more reasonable in comparison.
1.3.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.8.1.1.
1.3.8.4. Pro: Fighting hate must come from a place of moral legitimacy. Appearing to be intolerant, even to intolerance itself, undermines that perceived legitimacy.
1.3.8.5. Con: People use the law as a guide to what is right and wrong. Banning Hate speech sends the message that such speech is impermissible and wrong.
1.3.8.6. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.1.4.2.2.
1.3.8.7. Pro: Excluding certain ideas from public debate and discussion makes them difficult to engage with and refute.
1.3.8.7.1. Pro: These individuals flee to semi-anonymous forums such as Reddit or 4Chan, where they are able to engage within an echo chamber that never challenges them. When they are brought into the open, they can be debated and refuted.
1.3.8.7.1.1. Pro: Reddit is known for having a chain of sub-pages called ['The Chimpire'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversial_Reddit_communities) which is notorious for being racist.
1.3.8.7.1.1.1. Pro: In [November 2013](http://gawker.com/how-reddit-became-a-worse-black-hole-of-violent-racism-1690505395), a hyper-racist subreddit called "GreatApes" was formed where users posted epithet-strewn links to "news" stories of dubious origin that riffed on long established stereotypes about the black community.
1.3.8.7.1.1.2. Pro: [CoonTown](http://gawker.com/how-reddit-became-a-worse-black-hole-of-violent-racism-1690505395), a racist offshoot of The Chimpire with its 3,287 subscribers, ranked in the top 2% of popular subreddits.
1.3.8.7.1.1.2.1. Con: CoonTown's subreddit description specifically reads"No calls for violence." It is therefore within the limits of free speech that ought to be defended by the ACLU.
1.3.8.7.1.1.2.1.1. Con: That disclaimer is there to help the mods avoid legal liability. The sub itself was banned for inciting violence.
1.3.8.7.1.1.3. Pro: There are subreddits which specifically post articles on inciting violence against black Americans.
1.3.8.7.1.1.3.1. Pro: One [section of this forum](http://gawker.com/how-reddit-became-a-worse-black-hole-of-violent-racism-1690505395) is dedicated to watching black men die, while another features users wondering if there are any states left that are "Negro Free," while another is about how best to bring attention to the assertion that black people are more prone to commit sexual assaults than whites.
1.3.8.7.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.2.1.4.2.2.4.
1.3.8.7.2. Pro: ACLU executive director [Anthony Romero](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/08/16/politics/aclu-free-speech-white-supremacy/index.html) stated "Racism and bigotry will not be eradicated if we merely force them underground, Equality and justice will only be achieved if society looks such bigotry squarely in the eyes and renounces it."
1.3.8.7.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.5.2.1.1.
1.3.8.7.3. Con: Refutation of these ideas can happen through museums, documentaries, textbooks, and the many other ways Americans engage with the ideologies of the past.
1.3.8.8. Pro: -> See 1.3.8.7.2.
1.3.8.9. Pro: People should be allowed to judge the quality of all ideas on their merits and then affiliate themselves with an ideology that most closely aligns with their own. If the ACLU exists primarily to protect the interests of the people, it should allow everyone the opportunity to engage in this process.
1.3.8.9.1. Con: -> See 1.3.7.1.6.1.1.1.3.
1.3.8.9.2. Con: The debate on racism and bigotry is considered to be laid to rest by some, meaning debate is no longer necessary.
1.3.8.9.2.1. Pro: White supremacy and other similar views only serve to hold back discourse, rather than make the marketplace of ideas, which free speech protects, more effective.
1.3.8.9.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.1.6.7.
1.3.8.9.2.2. Con: As long as an idea is held by a sizable portion of society, it cannot meaningfully be declared "laid to rest."
1.3.8.9.2.2.1. Con: [1 in 4](http://time.com/7809/1-in-4-americans-thinks-sun-orbits-earth/) Americans believes the Sun orbits the Earth. Yet, clearly this does mean there should be debates on this matter.
1.3.8.10. Con: -> See 1.3.8.9.2.
1.4. Con: -> See 1.3.7.1.
1.5. Con: All speech, regardless of its content, should be protected.
1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.1.2.
1.5.2. Pro: The State is not an adequate actor to determine and regulate hate speech.
1.5.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.6.
1.5.2.2. Con: The reason the state is not a good actor to determine and regulate hate speech is because it has both a monopoly on speech and coercive force. But the ACLU does not have a monopoly on legal defense. White supremacists can just go elsewhere or pay for legal defense themselves.
1.5.2.2.1. Pro: This is the reason why private actors are allowed to restrict speech on their property, or for their employees.
1.5.2.3. Con: It is possible to have functional free speech protections while simultaneously harshly condemning hate speech, like in Germany.
1.5.2.3.1. Pro: The "slippery slope" argument is untrue. It is entirely possible to ban certain kinds of speech like white supremacy in a narrowly tailored manner.
1.5.2.3.2. Pro: It seems pretty clear that we know certain speech is harmful and not useful. It's unclear why banning Nazism for example really leads to a slippery slope.
1.5.2.4. Pro: A government which censors White Supremacists is a government which censors speech based on the ideas contained within. If the precedent is set it can be applied to other groups too.
1.5.2.5. Con: The rights of \(purported\) dangerous groups have been diminished in the past to preserve the safety of the public. For example, many states deprive felons of the right to bear arms.
1.5.2.5.1. Con: The deprivation of rights is specifically brought about at the completion of due process. White Supremacists should not be denied rights any more than you or I or a purported felon without the full execution of due process, of which the ACLU is intrinsically a part of.
1.5.2.5.2. Con: Felons are not denied rights because they are part of a group, but because of individual action.
1.5.2.6. Con: Certain kinds of speech are so hateful and so imbued with a nation's past that they must be banned. Nazi speech in Germany is one such example.
1.5.2.6.1. Pro: White supremacy has a long history in the United States of making the lives of POC a literal hell. It is fundamentally different from other kinds of speech in the US for this reason.
1.5.2.6.2. Pro: Violent white supremacy has a particular potency and tendency to emerge even when it seems to have been relegated to the history books.
1.5.2.6.2.1. Pro: The Ku Klux Klan came back in the early 20th century after fading out in after the end of Reconstruction. It then emerged again in the 1960's as the Civil Rights movement created massive backlash.
1.5.2.6.2.2. Pro: White supremacists are riding a new wave of popularity after the election of the first black president.
1.5.2.6.3. Con: This provides a subjective and incoherent standard for nations should ban speech which is subject to abuse.
1.5.2.6.3.1. Pro: Often it is the case that reasonable views and ideologies are associated with regimes or groups which performed atrocities. There is no way to tell the difference short of full state interference in the market place of ideas to make subjective value judgement.
1.5.2.6.3.2. Con: White supremacy is just as bad as jihad or terror organizations. They have no peaceful purpose and no real meaning.
1.5.2.6.4. Pro: Germany has very strong Hate crime laws specifically because of and as a form of recompense for their past. It would not be unreasonable for the US to do something similar.
1.5.2.7. Con: The responsibility of the government is to better the lives of the individuals in its society. Since hate speech is detrimental to the people it targets, it is the government's responsibility to protect them.
1.5.2.8. Pro: The US government has often abused its power to restrict freedom of speech.
1.5.2.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.1.3.
1.5.2.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.1.2.
1.5.2.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.1.1.
1.5.2.8.4. Pro: Numerous anti-protest bills, including laws in South Dakota and Tennessee prohibiting blocking streets during protests, have recently been[passed or proposed.](http://www.icnl.org/usprotestlawtracker/)
1.5.2.8.5. Pro: Certain jurisdictions [deter](https://www.thenation.com/article/americas-freedom-protest-attack/) activities by charging hefty fees simply for the right to stage a public demonstration.
1.5.2.9. Pro: The use of a standard by the State  to define hate speech will invite discrimination or censorship as a result of dangerously broad discretion regarding the implementation of the standard.
1.5.2.9.1. Con: -> See 1.5.2.3.
1.5.2.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.8.
1.5.2.9.3. Pro: The State acts in the name of the majority or of those in power, not disadvantaged minorities. Too often minorities have found themselves unfairly persecuted by the US government.
1.5.2.9.4. Pro: Both the President of the United States and the Attorney General of the United States [draw equivalencies](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/the-most-shortsighted-attack-on-free-speech-in-modern-history/537468/) between white supremacists and counter protesters, conflating Antifa with Black Lives Matters.
1.5.2.9.5. Pro: A standard for hate speech may be unequally applied, resulting in greater protections for certain minority groups versus others.
1.5.2.10. Pro: A functioning democracy requires a marketplace of ideas.
1.5.2.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.2.1.2.1.
1.5.2.10.2. Con: -> See 1.3.8.9.2.1.
1.5.2.10.3. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.1.4.2.2.
1.5.2.10.4. Pro: In order for a marketplace of ideas to exist, the state must remain neutral rather than choosing which ideas are allowed and which are not.
1.5.3. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.
1.5.4. Con: -> See 1.5.2.6.
1.5.5. Con: -> See 1.1.4.
1.5.6. Pro: It is not convincing or consistent for one to argue against those who advocate intolerance by expressing one's intolerance of their intolerance.
1.5.6.1. Pro: It is very unlikely that any single decision to draw the lines between acceptable tolerance and unacceptable intolerance in speech will be regarded as absolutely competent.
1.5.6.2. Pro: It is very unlikely that any single authority within society is qualified to draw the lines between acceptable tolerance and unacceptable intolerance in speech.
1.5.6.2.1. Con: The role of our government is to protect and serve the public. This would mean that they would be the people qualified to define "acceptable tolerance and unacceptable intolerance" as this would inherently lead to a [hate crime](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-hatecrime-fbi/u-s-hate-crimes-rise-for-second-straight-year-fbi-idUSKBN1DD2BA) if not handled efficiently and therefore harming the public.
1.5.6.3. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.1.2.2.3.
1.5.7. Con: -> See 1.3.7.1.6.7.
1.5.8. Con: Many people believe that hate speech ought to be banned.
1.5.8.1. Pro: The European court of human rights [found](https://www.hrlc.org.au/human-rights-case-summaries/2017/9/26/european-court-of-human-rights-finds-hate-speech-not-protected-by-freedom-of-expression) hate speech not protected under a person's freedom of expression. This demonstrates that all speech is not believed to need protection throughout the world.
1.5.8.1.1. Con: The European court of human rights has no jurisdiction over the American Civil Liberties Union \(ACLU\).
1.5.8.1.2. Con: In this case the defendant was inciting violence against his targets, which is not the same thing as hate speech, though he did use hate speech as well.
1.5.8.1.3. Con: Just because a court decides something does not mean they are right. US courts upheld the Fugitive Slave Act, and certainly slavery was a bad thing.
1.5.8.2. Pro: "A 2015 Pew Research Center [poll](https://www.aclu.org/blog/free-speech/why-we-must-defend-free-speech) reported that 40 percent of millennials think the government should be able to suppress speech deemed offensive to minority groups, as compared to only 12 percent of those born between 1928 and 1945." The concept of freedom of all speech is viewed as less important to the younger generation.
1.5.8.2.1. Con: 40% is not a majority, that would mean that 60% of millennials, a majority, think that the government should not suppress speech, or are at least unsure about it.
1.5.8.2.2. Con: Popularity has nothing to do with what is right or wrong. It was popular to kill left handed people in the medieval era, however that does not mean that it is right.
1.5.8.3. Con: -> See 1.5.8.2.2.
1.5.8.4. Con: -> See 1.2.6.2.1.1.
1.5.9. Pro: It is difficult to draw a clear line showing at which point an individual or organisation has proven to be too offensive for the ACLU to defend. This means that it is very difficult for the ACLU to have a policy of not defending certain groups without appearing to be arbitrary.
1.5.10. Pro: The marketplace of ideas will win out. And it is far superior to allowing a person, entity, government, or majority to--at some point--decide that a particular minority viewpoint must exit the marketplace.
1.5.11. Pro: Only unpopular speech requires protection; speech that most people find agreeable does not need the ACLU to fight on its behalf.
1.5.12. Pro: Take a look at Germany - it starts with censorship of internet and law-suit against free-minded journalists but it will not be the end. Any free speech regulation is dangerous and harmful for a democratic society. It starts with defining "hate speech" \(the more vague the better\) and it end with "hate crime". Believe me you don`t want it. I know too well as the EU citizen and my concerns grow every month.
1.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.1.6.
1.7. Con: If defending everyone equally, to access illusive fundamental justice is it's mandate, then defending white supremacist will support that mandate.
1.7.1. Pro: If the only discriminating factor is that they are from a so called "white supremacist" group then not defending them validates their existence.
1.7.2. Pro: Their mission is "to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties guaranteed to every person in this country by the Constitution and laws of the United States." Maximizing donations isn't included.
1.8. Pro: Support for white supremacy movements has recently caused a [decline in donations](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/17/nyregion/aclu-free-speech-rights-charlottesville-skokie-rally.html) to the ACLU.
1.8.1. Con: Donations to the ACLU have [spiked](http://time.com/4570796/aclu-planned-parenthood-donation-increase-donald-trump/) since Trump's election.
1.8.1.1. Pro: The Vermont ACLU [tripled](http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/politics/2017/03/20/vermont-aclu-triples-membership-after-donald-trump-election/99406068/) in size after November.
1.8.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.
1.8.3. Con: Many of the ACLU's most ardent supporters are [Libertarians](https://www.vox.com/2017/8/20/16167870/aclu-hate-speech-nazis-charlottesville), by taking a stance against defending free speech in all cases, they will lose these donors instead.
1.8.4. Pro: Donations to the ACLU decrease after a violent event at an ACLU supported event. Thus, if they continue to support events were violence happens, their donation stream will decrease more and more quickly.
1.8.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.1.5.
1.8.6. Con: -> See 1.2.6.
1.8.7. Pro: The ACLU needs all the money they can get given the current political climate.
1.8.7.1. Con: -> See 1.8.1.
1.8.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.2.
1.8.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.6.2.
1.8.8. Pro: When the ACLU needs money, they are unable to properly pursue other, more important objectives.
1.8.8.1. Pro: The ACLU has been critical in defending minorities and other groups, like the poor, from violations of their rights when these groups did not have the resources to defend themselves.
1.8.8.1.1. Pro: In an [open letter](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/10/the-aclu-should-keep-representing-deplorables/542226/), ACLU staff members argued that “our broader mission—which includes advancing the racial justice guarantees in the Constitution and elsewhere, not just the First Amendment—continues to be undermined by our rigid stance.”
1.8.8.2. Pro: The ACLU is critical for lobbying politicians not to support legislation that violates people's civic and political rights.
1.8.8.3. Pro: The ACLU has been an important force in challenging laws in the justice system. They are involved in [numerous](https://www.aclu.org/defending-our-rights/court-battles/supreme-court) cases each year.
1.8.8.3.1. Pro: In 2015, after decades of effort, the ACLU won a landmark Supreme Court victory in [Obergefell v. Hodges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges), which made the freedom to marry legal in all states.
1.8.8.3.2. Pro: Over the last five years, [ACLU advocates](https://www.aclu.org/aclu-accomplishments) have helped block over 300 laws aimed at restricting reproductive rights all across the United States.
1.8.8.3.3. Pro: In [2010](https://www.aclu.org/aclu-accomplishments), an Air Force major discharged because of her sexual orientation was reinstated, contributing to the eventual repeal of the discriminatory and unconstitutional "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy.
1.8.8.4. Con: The point of the ACLU is that it doesn't prioritize the rights of some over the rights of others.
1.8.9. Con: Abandoning your central values in pursuit of donations is anathema to the ACLU's guiding policy of maintaining a firm stance in defense of principles.
1.8.9.1. Pro: Similarly, the ACLU could probably increase donations from conservatives if it stopped defending people like Edward Snowden or Chelsea Manning, but it's clear that this would be a complete betrayal of the organisation's principles. Concerns surrounding donations must be subjugated to the question of whether or not an action is in line with the ACLU's core values.
1.8.9.1.1. Con: If ceasing to defend individuals such as Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden meant the ACLU had more resources to spend on defending speech rights for marginalized communities, that might be justifiable. The reason the ACLU does not do this currently is simply because it values the utility of encouraging whistle blowers, not because of some nebulous "principle."
1.8.9.1.1.1. Con: Defending people's right to be a whistleblower is a principle.
1.9. Con: Restricting the free speech of hate groups will spur an increase in both the strength and numbers of these movements.
1.9.1. Pro: Many white supremacist rallies are held under the guise of being "pro free-speech." Events in [Boston](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-protests/boston-march-against-hate-speech-avoids-charlottesville-chaos-idUSKCN1AZ0BU?ref=hvper.com) and [Berkeley](http://deadline.com/2017/09/uc-berkeley-free-speech-week-milo-yiannopoulos-canceled-alt-right-liberal-ann-coulter-steve-bannon-1202175650/), for instance.
1.9.1.1. Pro: When the KKK and other Neo-Nazi parties got involved in the [Charlottesville rally](https://www.vox.com/2017/8/12/16138246/charlottesville-nazi-rally-right-uva), spokespeople for these groups quickly claimed that it was just a free speech protest.
1.9.1.2. Pro: [The Trump Free Speech](http://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-41297284/pro-trump-rally-the-value-of-free-speech-is-under-assault) rally organized in Portland, Oregon was attended by white supremacists.
1.9.1.2.1. Con: This rally was protested but altogether, both rallies remained quite peaceful. This goes to show that white supremacist as well as liberal and central movements can happen at the same time, exercise their rights and still maintain a civil atmosphere.
1.9.1.2.2. Con: This rally was organized by [Patriot Prayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Prayer) who have openly criticized and denounced white supremacists. As such, it should not be termed a 'white supremacist' rally.
1.9.1.3. Pro: A cancelled white supremacist rally in [Berkeley, California](https://splinternews.com/anti-hate-activists-shutdown-planned-free-speech-rally-1798482734) was initially marketed as a demonstration for “free speech” and “against Marxism."
1.9.2. Pro: Restricting speech proves to potential followers of these movements that there is a tangible threat to American liberties.
1.9.2.1. Pro: Individuals often join these groups because they feel there is an existential threat to the "American" way of life.
1.9.3. Pro: Restricting free speech for these groups increases sympathy for people who disagree with them but want them to have the right to be heard.
1.9.3.1. Pro: This sympathy draws potential recruits into learning more about White Supremacists groups, joining racist social circles, and coming to group events.
1.9.4. Con: Hate groups are far less able to recruit new members when they can't appear in public to expose people to their ideology.
1.9.4.1. Con: This however means that people will only come across their ideology in a context where there is nobody to oppose it and rebut it. At least when this kind of speech appears in public there will almost always also be a counter-argument.
1.9.4.2. Con: Hate groups are far more likely to recruit through mediums such as internet forums because they can reach more people and those people can contact white supremacists while remaining anonymous.
1.9.4.3. Pro: If people see hate groups as being publicly shunned, they are less likely to find them appealing.
1.9.5. Con: -> See 1.3.8.5.
1.9.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.8.
1.9.7. Con: Presumably the situations in which the ACLU needs to defend these groups in the first place is one in which their free speech is already being restricted, so the increase in sympathy for them will happen immaterial of the ACLU's actions.
1.9.7.1. Pro: If anything, the ACLU defending these groups draws even more attention to them, increasing their strength further.
