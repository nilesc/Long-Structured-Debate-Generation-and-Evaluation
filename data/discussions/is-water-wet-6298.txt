Discussion Title: Is water wet?

1. Water is wet.
1.1. Con: Pure water \(H20\) does not exist on Earth. Earth's water contains dissolved solids and gases. Wetness may not necessarily be a property of water but rather the effect of something dissolved in it.
1.1.1. Con: Pure water can be made in a laboratory, and it's still wet.
1.1.2. Pro: Water can feel soft or hard depending on what's in it. Phosphates make it soft. Calcium makes it hard.
1.1.2.1. Pro: ["Dry Water"](https://gizmodo.com/5624936/there-is-such-thing-as-dry-water) is a white powder that is 95% water mixed with 5% silica.
1.1.3. Con: The term 'water' is not used to refer exclusively to pure H2O, but other substances consisting largely of H2O, with other compounds mixed in.
1.2. Con: Anything that can be wet can also be dry or else there is no reason to describe it as wet. It follows that anything that cannot be dry cannot be wet. Since water cannot be dry, it cannot be wet.
1.2.1. Con: Water permeates every square centimeter of the surface of the Earth yet not everything is considered wet. The driest air ever measured on Earth was still 1% relative humidity!
1.2.1.1. Con: Humankind has designed an infinite number of spectra to derive meaning from things and attribute linguistic signs to them, and the far ends of these are where we invent words; this is why 'wet' does not apply to everything on Earth, but only to things so far along the 'in contact with water molecules in some way' spectrum that we deem them worthy of the term.
1.2.2. Con: Water can both freeze, vaporise, and be absorbed which would be considered dry, just like how very dry air still contains water.
1.2.3. Con: Not having a reason to describe something as having it's opposite property does not mean it does not have that property. [For example](https://cryo.gsfc.nasa.gov/introduction/liquid_helium.html), helium can be a fluid or gas but not a solid. The fact that it can't be solid does not imply that it can't be a fluid or a gas.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Hydrophobic materials cannot be wet, which doesn't mean we cannot describe them as being dry.
1.2.4. Con: Something that cannot be dry has to be wet.
1.2.5. Con: The logic starts from a flawed assumption, namely that everything currently wet can also be dry.  Some things are mutually exclusive.  For example, if I describe the charge of an electron as "negative," that doesn't mean that it is sometimes "positive."  Also, "wet" describes the current state of something, not any other possible states.  To say that water is "wet," doesn't mean that it is sometimes "dry."  If I say that you are a "human," that doesn't mean that some days you are a "chipmunk."
1.2.6. Pro: Aristotelian [metaphysics](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-metaphysics/) predicates properties of substance through contraries \(such as "hot" and "cold" or "wet" and "dry"\). From this perspective It would be meaningless to predicate wetness of the substance water if one could not predicate dryness of it.
1.2.6.1. Con: Aristotelian metaphysics also distinguishes between predicates that are predicated of a substance \(accidents\) and predicates that are predicated in it \(essences\). It could be that wetness is predicated of water in the latter sense.
1.2.7. Pro: As Socrates argues in Plato's [Phaedo](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170%3Atext%3DPhaedo%3Asection%3D70e), something can only become what it is from its opposite \(otherwise it would always be\). Thus water can only become wet from a prior state of dryness.
1.2.7.1. Con: On Plato's account, water is not necessarily a substance - so while it may be that all matter becomes wet from a state of dryness and dry from a state of wetness, that it is nonetheless only water when it is in a state of wetness.
1.3. Con: Wetness is a property of experience rather than of water itself.
1.3.1. Con: It is not irrational to believe that water is wet when we are not in contact with it, even if we can't know this for sure.
1.3.2. Con: We are capable of using scientific tools to measure and record certain properties of water without any human being directly experiencing water; the properties remain the same in any case.
1.3.3. Pro: Water is an elementary word that is more than a description of H2O in liquid form. It is a fundamental tactile experience that all of humanity shares. We do not need to say "I would like a wet water to drink" as it would be tautological. We know what water feels like when we drink it and when we touch it. The word we use to describe that sensation is wet.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Water cannot be wet to organisms without the senses necessary to experience it. Therefore, it cannot be wet in absolute terms.
1.3.4. Pro: Wetness may correspond to structures in physical space \(water\), but even materialism supports the view that it is nonetheless an experience independent of these structures.
1.3.4.1. Pro: When we dream of touching water, it can feel wet even though there is no physical H2O associated with it.
1.4. Pro: Anything that is covered or saturated by a liquid is considered "[wet](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/wet)".
1.4.1. Con: "Covered" refers to the surface, the surface is defined by the outermost boundary of the aggregate compound. Liquid water can not touch other liquid water while maintaining the boundary, thus it can not be wet. Similarly, saturation is used in a similar manner in this instance, referring to adsorption, and thus water can not become wet by the same logic.
1.4.2. Pro: Individual water molecules are in contact with other water molecules, which in turn qualifies each water molecule as "saturated" by all of the water molecules which surround it.
1.4.2.1. Con: Water molecules [bond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bond) to one another in a manner vastly different to the bond which exists between a water molecule and a non-water molecule.
1.4.3. Con: In a strictly scientific sense, wetness refers to the [adsorption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsorption) \(not to be confused with absorption\) of liquid \(and in some contexts specifically water\) on a surface. Pure liquid water can not be wet in this sense because its surface is definitively bounded by a substance other than water.
1.5. Pro: Trivially true by definition. Water has chemical properties, including viscosity and cooling properties, which are based upon it's respective ease of evaporation. One could describe any other substance sharing such properties with water as feeling "wet", such as a light oil. If a substance very similar to water can be considered "wet"— water should not be removed from this category.
1.5.1. Pro: "Trivially true" in that, [according to Kant](https://www.britannica.com/topic/epistemology/The-history-of-epistemology#ref309019), it is an analytic a priori claim. "Wetness" may be defined as something that is "liquid." "Water" \(vs ice, steam\) is liquid, and therefore it instantiates "wetness." It can also be stated as a logical argument \([modus ponens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens)\): If something is a liquid, it is wet. Water is a liquid. Therefore, water is wet.
1.5.1.1. Con: "Wetness" cannot be defined purely as something that is "liquid". A cotton shirt can be wet, although it's not liquid.
1.6. Con: Water is sometimes dry even in a broad definition of wetness. Specifically, ice and snow well below the freezing point is devoid of liquid water on its surface or in its pores and thus may be described as 'dry'.
1.6.1. Pro: In certain circumstances, around 0'C, water can be wet, when it is solid ice, but it cannot be wet when it is a liquid.
1.6.2. Con: Liquid form is explicit in most of the [definitions of the water](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/water), therefore ice and snow are not water, but rather solid states of its constituents.
1.6.3. Pro: As stated in the Oxford dictionary, wet defines something or an item that had once been dry. Water cannot be [dry](https://www.thenakedscientists.com/forum/index.php?topic=18831.0). Also, water makes other things wet along with other liquids, this means that water is not wet. Things that are wet can be fully wet or just a little wet, water cannot have that.
1.7. Con: Wetness is a predicate that applies to substances different than water, that contain water molecules, or directly touch water.
1.7.1. Pro: Describing water as "wet" is a misuse only grounded in the fact that water can make other substances wet.
1.7.1.1. Pro: Thought experiment: Imagine it was impossible for water to make anything wet, \(for example if every single substance on earth was hydrophobic\) then there would be no reason for language users to create predicate "being wet". It wouldn't describe any property of water.
1.7.1.2. Pro: In the sentence "water is wet" notion "wet" is equivalent to "can make things wet", which makes the predicate "wet" in this sentence mean something different than in "shirt is wet". Thus the meaning of "wet" in the first sentence is not literal, but metaphorical.
1.7.2. Pro: Being a liquid, water is not [itself wet](http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=6097), but can make other solid materials wet.
1.8. Pro: Everything water touches is said to be "wet", without exclusion \(implicit or explicit\) for other bodies of water.
1.8.1. Pro: Being wet is a consequence of the action of water, meaning that the water itself must also be wet in order to pass this characteristic on to anything else.
1.8.1.1. Con: Something can come to have a certain property by a cause that does not itself have that property. For example, the sun's rays can be focused to cause a fire even though light is not itself a form of fire.
1.8.1.2. Con: The balance between [cohesive and adhesive forces](http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=6097) of water determines if it's wet, and this changes. Therefore the action of water changes making its ability to be wet non-absolute.
1.8.2. Pro: Water is characteristically wet in the same way that Gilbert Ryle defines glass as characteristically brittle in his book 'Concept of the Mind'; "the glass cracked because it was brittle" and "the water soaked the carpet because it was wet" are both examples of characteristics of substances that cannot be observed unless an external force reveals it. The glass needs force exerted on it to reveal it's brittleness, the water has to come into contact with something to reveal its wetness.
1.8.3. Con: Pouring water into another body of water simply increases the volume of the agent which causes other materials to become wet.
1.8.4. Con: Our idea of wetness is determined by the state of the object the water alters. "Wetness" cannot exist without a modification to a prior idea taking place.
1.9. Con: Water only has the capability to wet other things, in and of itself it is not.
1.10. Pro: Strong tetrahedral hydrogen bonding was the answer given by[Richard Saykally](http://nautil.us/issue/25/water/ingenious-richard-saykally) \(who is a professor of chemistry at UC Berkely\) when Nautilus asked him this very question. The gist is that this bond between hydrogen atoms is more than just cohesion, and is unique to water.
