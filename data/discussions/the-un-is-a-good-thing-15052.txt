Discussion Title: The UN is a Good Thing

1. The UN is a good thing
1.1. Con: The UN has often put it's effort in the wrong places.
1.1.1. Pro: Especially in developing countries, they provide funds to focus on situations that aren't real problems, perhaps because of vested political interests. This potrays those situations in limelight which undermines the gravity of 'Real existing problems' and shifts focus away from actual effects of what people are facing.
1.1.2. Con: Its an impossible feat to get every mission correct with so many moving parts involved.
1.1.3. Con: The UN can learn from these mistakes to better assist countries in the future.
1.1.4. Pro: The UN is failing regarding the Israel/Palestinian conflict.
1.1.4.1. Pro: The UN has created the state of Israel, by assigning land to a specific sect of religious practioners that was not agreed upon by the \(then\) natives of that land. This has been a source of conflict for over 60 years.
1.1.4.2. Con: The British created the modern problem, and [passed it off to the UN afterwards](https://youtu.be/1wo2TLlMhiw?t=4m58s).
1.1.4.3. Pro: The UNHRC has condemned Israel [more than the rest of the world’s countries combined](https://www.unwatch.org/report-in-9-years-existence-unhrc-condemned-israel-more-times-than-rest-of-world-combined/), [despite](https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/2016_ITF_Human_Rights_Index_2016-01.pdf) [most](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_freedom_indices) [indexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_in_the_World) not listing Israel as a top Human Rights offender.
1.1.4.3.1. Con: [Israel deserves condemnation](https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/israel-and-occupied-palestinian-territories/report-israel-and-occupied-palestinian-territories/), and as one of the longest running and most prominent conflicts in the world, the Israel/Palestine conflict deserves the extra attention.
1.1.5. Con: UN is a good platform however there are few negatives that are being shown in Mr.Kofi Annan \(RIP\) Report and same should be came into force.
1.2. Pro: The UN has not reached its prime. Whilst it may fall short of our hopes, we have more cause for hope with, than without, it.
1.2.1. Pro: An institution, once established, can be improved.
1.2.2. Pro: The UN is [open and self-critical](https://www.un.org/press/en/2016/sg2235.doc.htm) of it's shortcomings, and regularly takes steps to improve.
1.2.2.1. Pro: The UN gives the independent NGO "[UNWatch](https://www.unwatch.org/about-us/mission-history/)" Special Consultative Status.  This includes access to proceedings and allotted time to talk.  UNWatch's mission statement is to to "monitor the performance of the United Nations by the yardstick of its own Charter".
1.2.2.2. Pro: The Office of Internal Oversight Services  \(OIOS\) [issued 204 oversight reports](http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/72/330\(PARTII\)&referer=/english/&Lang=E) relating to peace operations in 2017. They included 552 recommendations, 13 of which were classified as "critical" and 407 "important".
1.2.2.2.1. Pro: In the [2017 Internal Oversight audit](http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/72/330\(PARTII\)&referer=/english/&Lang=E), the highest number of reports were related to sexual exploitation and abuse, with 69 reports issued, constituting 55 percent of all reports issued in 2017. Of those, sufficient evidence of misconduct was found in 45 reports.
1.2.3. Pro: The UN may not be at their best shape to do their job \(protect international peace\) but it is the only one there is at the present moment to do the job. The UN needs to be vested with more powers of mediation and peace-keeping forces.
1.2.3.1. Con: Vesting an arguably corrupt organisation with even more power will just increase their potential for more corruption.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: The UN is corrupt.
1.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: The Oil-for-Food Programme suffered from widespread corruption and abuse, including [$1.5 billion from kickbacks](https://www.ft.com/content/3ea6c5a4-46fc-11da-b8e5-00000e2511c8).
1.2.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Many countries were [receiving Iraqi oil at discount prices](https://www.thetrumpet.com/1853-the-corruption-of-the-united-nations) through this program, including some of the same countries that opposed the war on Iraq so vehemently.
1.2.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: The independent [report](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/08_09_05_volume1.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwj2ifvFuZfcAhWEUhQKHYmmBOAQFjADegQIABAB&usg=AOvVaw1gT8HssnihYL8lCkvyhNQJ) on the oil-for-food scandal [criticised the UN from top to bottom](https://www.thetrumpet.com/1853-the-corruption-of-the-united-nations), saying: “The inescapable conclusion from the committee’s work” is that the UN “needs thorough reform—and it needs it urgently.”
1.2.3.1.1.2. Con: Any organisation the size of the UN will eventually encounter corruption.  If it is well handled, it is not a problem.
1.2.3.1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.1.1.1.2.
1.2.3.1.1.2.2. Pro: The global cost of corruption is at least [$2.6 trillion, or 5 per cent of the global gross domestic product \(GDP\)](https://www.un.org/press/en/2018/sc13493.doc.htm). Some corruption is unavoidable, and the UN has lower corruption than the global average.
1.2.3.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: UN internal audits found [lower fraud rate than other public bodies](https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Investigation-into-the-Departments-approach-to-tackling-fraud.pdf),  0.03% compared to 1% - 5%.
1.2.3.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: This is likely to be an indication of failed fraud reporting, not a lack of fraud.
1.2.3.1.1.2.3. Con: Independent Watchdog JIU found that “more than half \[of UN staff\] indicated that they believe that [fraudulent behavior goes unpunished in their organization](http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/07/12/fraud-what-fraud-watchdogs-find-un-in-state-near-denial-about-internal-corruption.html)”.
1.2.3.1.1.3. Con: The UN has delivered a major international [Anti-Corruption treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_against_Corruption)
1.2.3.1.1.4. Pro: Former UN procurement official Alexander Yakovlev had received in [excess of $950,000 in bribes](https://www.thetrumpet.com/1853-the-corruption-of-the-united-nations) from companies that were responsible for more than $79 million in UN contracts and purchase orders.
1.2.3.1.1.5. Pro: The UN appointing Saudi Arabia head of the Human Rights Panel was due to corruption.
1.2.3.1.1.5.1. Pro: The UN [appointed Saudi Arabia](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/anger-after-saudi-arabia-chosen-to-head-key-un-human-rights-panel-10509716.html?) to head key UN human rights panel, despite having “[arguably the worst \[human rights\] record in the world](http://speisa.com/modules/articles/index.php/item.1955/scandalous-saudi-arabia-chosen-to-head-key-un-human-rights-panel.html)”.
1.2.3.1.1.5.1.1. Pro: Saudi Arabia hires a major PR firm, accused of ["whitewashing serious human rights abuses"](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/pr-firm-accused-of-helping-saudi-arabia-whitewash-its-human-rights-record-a6937271.html).
1.2.3.1.1.5.2. Con: The application process involves a [vote in the general assembly](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.brookings.edu/opinions/5-myths-about-the-u-n-human-rights-council/amp/), so the elected members are democratically selected by all.
1.2.3.1.1.5.2.1. Pro: To be elected to one of the 47 seats, a country must receive [at least an absolute majority](https://www.heritage.org/report/un-human-rights-council-flawed-body-should-be-replaced) in a General Assembly secret ballot.
1.2.3.1.1.5.2.2. Pro: Voting countries are urged to “take into account the contribution of candidates to the promotion and protection of human rights and their voluntary pledges and commitments made thereto."
1.2.3.1.1.5.2.3. Con: The vote could be achieved democratically but without inappropriate states being selected, by removing the "five regional groups" system, which causes ‘closed slates’ \(where the number of candidates matches the number of available seats\).
1.2.3.1.1.5.2.4. Pro: The UN cannot be blamed for the results of a democratic election.  The blame lies with every country who voted for the inappropriate members.
1.2.3.1.1.5.2.5. Pro: [Several particularly inappropriate candidates](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/foreignpolicy.com/2017/12/01/how-not-to-fix-the-un-human-rights-council-trump-haley-israel-palestine/amp/) were either rejected through the vote \(Belarus, Azerbaijan, Sri Lanka\) or withdrew their candidacy rather than face a humiliating defeat \(Syria, Iraq\).
1.2.3.1.1.5.2.6. Pro: The UN has the [Universal periodic review \(UPR\)](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/BasicFacts.aspx), a periodic review of the human rights records of all 193 UN Member States to help measure and reveal any countries failing to meet human rights standards.
1.2.3.1.1.5.2.6.1. Pro: To date, the UPR process has garnered a remarkable [100 percent participation rate](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.brookings.edu/opinions/5-myths-about-the-u-n-human-rights-council/amp/) with more and more states accepting recommendations on everything from women’s rights to torture. These assessments attract much-needed media attention in countries under review, give some room \(but not enough\) to civil society participation, and elevate human rights on the agenda of government ministries across the board.
1.2.3.1.1.5.2.6.2. Pro: Nearly half of the recommendations made by the UPR were [partially or fully implemented](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.brookings.edu/opinions/5-myths-about-the-u-n-human-rights-council/amp/) just two-and-a-half years after the first round of reviews.
1.2.3.1.1.5.3. Con: This was not corruption, but a result of other states in the region not applying to be members.
1.2.3.1.1.6. Con: -> See 1.2.3.1.1.2.2.1.
1.2.3.1.1.7. Pro: [Independent JIC report](https://www.unjiu.org/sites/www.unjiu.org/files/jiu_document_files/products/en/reports-notes/JIU%20Products/JIU_REP_2016_4_English.pdf) says "Much more needs to be done to combat fraud in the United Nations system".
1.2.3.1.1.8. Pro: Even the UN's own internal Office of Internal Oversight Services’ \(OIOS\) [gave only a “partially satisfactory”](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-un-corruption-exclusive/exclusive-u-n-audit-identifies-serious-lapses-linked-to-alleged-bribery-idUSKCN0X00VD) rating.
1.2.3.1.1.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.2.
1.2.3.1.1.9. Pro: Former U.N. General Assembly president John Ashe \(alongside Ambassador Lorenzo and [four others](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/newyork/news/press-releases/former-un-general-assembly-president-and-five-others-charged-in-1.3-million-bribery-scheme)\) took [$1.3million](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-un-corruption-exclusive/exclusive-u-n-audit-identifies-serious-lapses-linked-to-alleged-bribery-idUSKCN0X00VD) from a bribery scheme.
1.2.3.1.1.9.1. Pro: United States prosecutors said, he was part of a bribery scheme that involved more than [$1 million in payments](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/23/world/americas/john-ashe-ex-diplomat-accused-in-un-corruption-case-dies-at-61.html) from sources in China for assistance in real estate deals and other business interests.
1.2.3.1.1.9.2. Con: John Ashe was never convicted - he died awaiting trial.
1.2.3.1.1.9.2.1. Con: Fellow ambassador "Lorenzo" pleaded guilty to the bribery and money laundering, and the bribers were also convicted.  Therefore, John Ashe would certainly have been convicted if the trial had continued in absentia.
1.2.3.1.1.9.3. Pro: David Ng was [convicted after a four-week trial](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/chairman-macau-based-real-estate-development-company-convicted-trial-all-counts) on six counts in connection with his multi-year scheme to pay more than $1.3 million in bribes to ambassadors of the UN.
1.2.3.1.1.9.4. Pro: John Ashe had great potential to have been involved in even more undiscovered corruption.

Since 2009 he had been at a Chair or higher level, including being on the Executive Boards UNDP, UNFPA, and President at UNICEF.
1.2.4. Con: Although the UN can rightly claim many successes in its history, from a political perspective it has not appeared able to solve the world’s most pressing issues of the last 1-2 decades, suggesting it has indeed passed its prime.
1.2.4.1. Con: The issues facing the world in recent decades are harder to solve than previous world issues.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: In a 2015 internal report \([HIPPO](http://www.un.org/sg/pdf/HIPPO_Report_1_June_2015.pdf)\), officials warned peace operations today are deployed in an environment where there is little or no peace to keep, the current generation of conflicts is proving difficult to resolve, and that there is a widening gap between what is being asked of United Nations peace operations today and what they are able to deliver.
1.2.4.1.2. Con: It may not be they are harder to solve, per se, but that the UN has ossified and is structurally unable to solve them. For example, Trump appears to have made more progress with North Korea in a few months than the UN has in decades.
1.3. Con: The UN organisation is undemocratic.
1.3.1. Pro: The UN is made of nation-states who will ultimately pursue their own agenda. So little collective good is to be expected.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Influential countries \(for example US, China\) in the UN have their own agendas disadvantaging the underdeveloped countries \(mostly in Africa\).
1.3.1.1.1. Con: The bulk of the UN's $8bn per year spent on global peacekeeping, [goes to missions in Africa](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-38372614).
1.3.1.1.2. Con: The General Assembly recently approved a [$54 billion dollar budget](https://news.un.org/en/story/2017/12/640451-general-assembly-approves-54-billion-un-budget-next-two-years) for UN efforts in Africa over the biennium 2018-2019.
1.3.1.1.2.1. Con: This budget is $286 million below the budget for 2016-2017 and $193 million below a proposal made by the Secretary-General.
1.3.1.1.3. Pro: The UN's mission in South Sudan \(UNMISS\) was accused of [lacking neutrality by giving arms to rebels](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-38372614) in the town of Bentiu in 2013.
1.3.1.1.3.1. Pro: [The report](http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/publications/by-type/sudan-hsba.html) accused UNMISS of underreporting arms confiscated from fleeing soldiers and handing over the weapons to soldiers of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-in-Opposition \(SPLM-IO\) on more than one occasion.
Shortly after this transfer of arms, the rebels went on to carry out a massacre of civilians.
1.3.1.1.4. Con: The UN's IMF \(International Monetary Fund\) worked with the World Bank, AfDB and G8 to [write off $40 to $55 billion in debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals) owed by members of the heavily indebted poor countries \(HIPC\), [85% of which are in Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavily_indebted_poor_countries).
1.3.1.1.5. Con: The UN keeps a list of its 8 highest priority high-level areas of work.  [Africa is the only region earning its own spot in the list](http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/71/6%20\(Part%20One\)), amongst maintenance of international peace and security, promotion of human rights, etc..
This indicates that at a high level, support to African countries is high on the overall UN agenda.
1.3.1.2. Con: The [General Assembly](http://www.un.org/en/ga/) decides on all resolutions by vote, requiring a two-thirds majority to pass.
Nation-state agendas will not succeed unless supported by most of the world.
1.3.1.2.1. Pro: By each nation in the UN following their own agenda, the outcome of their discussions is most likely a resolution that shares common ground among most members. Collective good might be little, but is an equally shared win for almost everyone altogether.
1.3.2. Pro: The UN Security Council gives the unfair power of Veto to it's 5 permanent members:  China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States \(commonly called the P5\)
1.3.2.1. Con: Supporters of the veto power regard it as a [promoter of international stability](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/12/opinion/putin-plea-for-caution-from-russia-on-syria.html), a [check against military interventions](http://losangeles.china-consulate.org/eng/topnews/t1277592.htm), and a critical [safeguard against U.S. domination](https://www.rt.com/news/362914-us-russia-tensions-churkin-veto/).
1.3.2.2. Pro: Members of the P5 frequently use their veto power to single-handedly thwart otherwise popular proposals.
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: The United States made a [Security Council resolution for "immediate cease-fire and withdrawal of troops"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_Bangladesh#United_Nations) to stop the [1979 Bangladeshi Genocide](https://www.kialo.com/the-un-is-a-good-thing-15052/15052.0=15052.1-15052.15+15052.17), which was supported by the majority. However, the USSR vetoed the resolution twice and the United Kingdom and France abstained on the resolution.
1.3.2.2.2. Pro: In the Syria Conflict, Russian Veto [successfully paralysed the Security Council](https://news.sky.com/story/united-nations-frozen-in-place-by-russias-veto-power-on-syria-response-11324217) [multiple times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vetoed_United_Nations_Security_Council_resolutions_on_Syria?wprov=sfla1). Without passing all 5 security council vetos, the UN can do nothing to help a conflict.
1.3.2.3. Con: The ability to Veto is important, as otherwise such a broad selection of world superpowers would be more likely to break their own resolutions if they did not vote for it themselves.  While not perfect, it is a way to ensure that resolutions are realistically followed.
1.3.3. Pro: Observer states don't have Security Council voting rights.
1.3.3.1. Con: [Any state can be elected as one of 10 temporary members of the Security Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_members_of_the_United_Nations_Security_Council) \(1-2 year terms\).
As a Security Council would not function well with all states voting \(as in the General Assembly\), having permanent and temporary members is the most democratic solution which still functions.
1.3.3.2. Pro: If you're not the member of the Security Council, and the Security Council passes a resolution to the effect of sending military forces to your country and intervene in your disputes, you cannot even vote against it.
1.3.4. Con: The UN enables democracy in [67 countries](http://www.un.org/en/un-facts/index.html) by assisting with their elections.
1.3.4.1. Con: The UN doesn't seem to be doing anything about DRCongo, it is over a year overdue to hold an election.
1.3.4.1.1. Pro: Elections [due in December 2017 at the latest](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/drc-violence-shows-kabila-determined-stay-power-180101102949537.html) have still not happened, and incumbent Joseph Kabila has turned to violence.
1.3.4.1.2. Con: The MONUSCO force will facilitate a transfer of power in January 2019, by registering voters, observe and report human rights abuses, and help train train Congolese police to secure the polls.
This mandatory assistance could [scuttle Kabila's attempts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/joseph-kabila-drc-elections-monusco) to pass off a potentially flawed election as a legitimate affair.
1.3.5. Pro: Only about 41% of the U.N. member states are free democracies. Each country gets an equal vote in the General Assembly, so any decision can be considered largely undemocratic. - [src](http://qr.ae/TUTU7T)
1.4. Pro: The UN has pioneered [Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights).
1.4.1. Con: The United States [left the UN's human rights council](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/44537372), calling it 'a cesspool of political bias'.
1.4.1.1. Con: The United States is arguably, itself, "a cesspool of political bias".
1.4.1.2. Con: Donald Trumps America is increasingly isolationist.  It's decision to leave UN bodies is less a meaningful condemnation of the UN, and more consistent with their current nationalistic foreign policy of leaving international agreements/bodies.
1.4.1.2.1. Pro: America has left [Climate change Agreements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_withdrawal_from_the_Paris_Agreement), [trade partnerships](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/why-trump-killed-tpp-why-it-matters-you-n710781), and even [questioned](https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/trump-s-first-foreign-trip/donald-trump-nato-why-his-silence-article-5-big-deal-n765011) their NATO membership.
1.4.2. Con: The United Nations Human Rights Council \(UNHRC\) membership is full of inappropriate members.
1.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.1.5.1.
1.4.2.2. Pro: China, Russia, Cuba and Venezuela manage to get elected repeatedly, despite human rights violations.
1.4.2.3. Pro: Sudan, perpetrator of the world’s most recent genocide, [is a member](https://www.thetrumpet.com/1853-the-corruption-of-the-united-nations).
1.4.2.4. Pro: Zimbabwe, home to land grabs, internationally condemned elections, and a state-controlled press, [is a member](https://www.thetrumpet.com/1853-the-corruption-of-the-united-nations).
1.4.2.5. Con: From 2007-2015, a large majority of its membership has been composed of states that meet the free and partly free standards of Freedom House \([between 74 and 85 percent](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.brookings.edu/opinions/5-myths-about-the-u-n-human-rights-council/amp/)\).  Not-free states have never won more than about a quarter of the seats.
1.4.2.6. Con: -> See 1.2.3.1.1.5.2.
1.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.1.5.2.6.
1.4.4. Pro: 80 treaties/declarations in total have been achieved by the UN.
1.4.4.1. Con: Most, if not all, the treaties contain reservation systems which allow nations to ignore critical components of a treaty.
1.4.4.2. Con: UN treaties are frequently ignored, unimplemented, or ineffective.
1.4.5. Pro: The UN is good for Women's Rights, Equality, and representation.
1.4.5.1. Pro: The UN has [achieved gender parity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_United_Nations#cite_note-16) in its employees at the P-1 and P-2 levels of responsibility.
1.4.5.2. Con: UN Senior leadership as of 2015 was [made up of 78% men](http://www.un.org/womenwatch/uncoordination/documents/overview/unsystem/unsystem-infographic.pdf), and all grades above P3 have a male majority.
1.4.5.3. Pro: [UN Women](http://www.unwomen.org/en/about-us/about-un-women) and [UNIFEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Development_Fund_for_Women) work for global empowerment of women.
1.4.5.4. Pro: The UN [recently elected](https://www.facebook.com/unitednations/videos/10156576454165820/) their 4th female General Assembly president.
1.4.6. Pro: Migrants have their basic human rights preserved through the UN's [Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/world/europe/united-nations-migration-agreement.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FUnited%20Nations&action=click&contentCollection=timestopics&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=4&pgtype=collection).
1.4.7. Pro: The UN has [secured rights for LGBT individuals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_at_the_United_Nations) even if they are limited in some areas. Via vote, it has a majority of states supporting at least basic rights for LGBT individuals.
1.4.8. Pro: The UN serves as a place where oppressed groups can voice their grievances to the world.
1.4.9. Con: Pioneering in itself is void of accolades if the rights of many groups and humans are still in violation without resolve.
1.4.9.1. Con: [It is better to do something imperfectly than nothing perfectly.](https://www.brainyquote.com/photos_tr/en/r/roberthschuller/155997/roberthschuller1-2x.jpg)
1.5. Con: The world doesn't need an organisation like the UN.
1.5.1. Con: -> See discussion #5515: States should aim for more and stronger international institutions.
1.5.2. Pro: The Security Council is not needed, as Security is already upheld by NATO, the EU, and nation states cooperating.
1.5.2.1. Con: The UN is not only the Security Council. Without the UN and its different sub-organizations such as UNESCO a lot of historical places would have been destroyed, and WHO is participating in promoting healthcare. The HRCs contribution to Human rights is also needed.
1.5.2.2. Con: NATO and EU excludes many countries which would see their self-determination further jeopardized without an organization like the UN.
1.5.3. Pro: [Christian Futurism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurism_\(Christianity\)) says the beast \([numbered  666](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beast_\(Revelation\)) and signifying the Apocalypse\) in Revelation is a [symbol of a future worldwide political system](https://www.jw.org/en/bible-teachings/questions/what-does-666-mean/#?insight\[search_id\]=2434bb4d-ef98-42ea-a911-5959a2b2edd6&insight\[search_result_index\]=2) with "authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation" \([Chapter 13 : Verse 7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+13%3A1-10&version=KJV)\).
This fits the UN, as it has authority over every country and therefore all people and tongues.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Throughout Revelation the number 7 is used to represent completeness or perfection. The number 6 is "a man's number," symbolism imperfection. History shows and the discussion corroborates that the UN is far from perfect.
1.5.4. Con: In a world with almost [200](http://www.worldometers.info/geography/how-many-countries-are-there-in-the-world/) nations, an organization that gathers nations is needed.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Without the UN as a place for nations to discuss the issues with their allies and enemies, more chaos is likely to ensue.
1.5.5. Con: Global threats like climate change ask for more globally united responses then challenges of the past. Creating this unity from all countries to all countries would require 200^2 / 2 interactions, while the UN requires just 200 interactions \(if 200 is the number of nations\). The total of 200^2/2 interactions all coming out positively is not achievable, therefore an organisation like the UN is necessary.
1.6. Pro: No other organisation has provided more global health benefits than the UN, through the World Health Organization \(WHO\) and other branches \(UNICEF, WFP\).
1.6.1. Pro: The UN's [ODA set a target of 0.7% of GNI](https://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/ODA-history-of-the-0-7-target.pdf) for developed nations foreign aid spending.
1.6.1.1. Con: Fourty years in, the average contribution was only [0.4%](https://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/ODA-history-of-the-0-7-target.pdf).
1.6.1.1.1. Pro: The 2018 [OECD average](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5260997/UK-one-seven-nations-hit-foreign-0-7-aid-target.html) was only 0.32%.
1.6.1.2. Pro: Regardless if met fully or not, promoting such an international target is hugely beneficial for encouraging aid spending and formalising commitment to assisting developing countries.
1.6.1.3. Con: In 2015, [only 6 countries are meeting the target](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jan/04/uk-among-six-countries-hit-un-aid-spending-target-oecd) \(UK, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Sweden\).
1.6.2. Con: -> See 1.2.3.1.1.1.
1.6.3. Pro: The UN's [World Food Programme](http://www1.wfp.org/overview) \(WFP\) provides food assistance to [80 million people in 80 countries](http://www.un.org/en/un-facts/index.html) each year.
1.6.4. Pro: The UN is the only organisation to get 128 countries legally bound to take a range of measures to protect human health and the environment by addressing mercury throughout its lifecycle. All mercury mining has stopped and mercury recycling is being implemented globally.
1.6.5. Con: Although some branches of the UN may be good and effective, this does not mean that overall the UN is fit for purpose. If the UN was to be radically overhauled, parts that work relatively well like the WHO could be maintained.
1.6.6. Pro: The WHO is the [predominant agency associated with global health \(and international health\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_health)
1.6.7. Pro: UNICEF manages over [$5,000,000,000](https://www.unicef.org/about/execboard/files/2018-2021_Integrated_Budget_EB_Informal_23_June_FINAL.pdf) of aid for humanitarian and developmental assistance to children and mothers in developing countries.
1.6.8. Pro: The Global Humanitarian Overview \(GHO\) is appealing for and coordinates [$25.3 billion of humanitarian aid for 95.3 million people](http://interactive.unocha.org/publication/globalhumanitarianoverview/) in 2018.
1.6.9. Pro: [45%](http://www.un.org/en/un-facts/index.html) of all children in the world are vaccinated by the UN, saving 3 million lives a year.
1.7. Con: The UN's [cost](https://fts.unocha.org/appeals/overview/2018) is too high for it's output.
1.7.1. Con: The IMF and the World Bank secure financial stability, facilitate international trade, and enable sustainable economic growth. These global financial benefits offset much of the UN's budget costs.
1.7.2. Pro: Many who formerly worked with the UN have [reported on how inefficient](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/becky-tinsley-the-un-is-inefficient-wasteful-self-serving-and-plain-corrupt-313407.html) it can be when compared to "Small, lean Non-Governmental Organisations \(NGOs\)".
1.7.3. Con: US studies show that UN peacekeeping missions are an estimated [8 times more cost-effective](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/articles/2017-05-30/peacekeeping-cost-effective-must-adapt-new-reality) than when the US acts alone.
1.8. Con: -> See 1.2.3.1.1.
1.9. Pro: The UN leads in battling climate change.
1.9.1. Pro: The UN achieved the [Paris Agreement](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-35073297), achieving consensus among nearly 200 countries for the first time in history.
1.9.1.1. Con: The UN lost a key polluter from the agreement, [the USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_withdrawal_from_the_Paris_Agreement).
1.9.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.2.
1.9.1.2. Pro: The Paris Agreement is the only global pact stipulating action on temperature rises. [If scientists are right](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/67/12/1026/4605229), this could save planet earth and therefore be the most important agreement ever made.
1.9.2. Pro: Since 1992, the [UNFCCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change) has helped get nations to curb Greenhouse Gas emissions.
1.9.2.1. Pro: UNFCCC created the legally binding [Kyoto Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol).
1.9.2.1.1. Pro: All 37 countries that signed up succeeded in meeting the target: reducing their mean annual greenhouse gas emissions from 2008-2012 by an average of 5% relative to the levels seen in 1990.
1.9.2.1.2. Pro: Overall, [they surpassed their commitment](http://www.alphr.com/environment/1003699/climate-change-figures-show-kyoto-protocol-was-a-success-or-do-they) by 2.4 gigatonnes of CO2 per year.
1.9.2.1.3. Con: [The US and Canada failed](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2093579-was-kyoto-climate-deal-a-success-figures-reveal-mixed-results/).
1.9.2.1.4. Con: Ten countries achieved their targets only by buying carbon credits. This means that [0.3 GtCO2 per year of the claimed reductions were not true cuts.](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2093579-was-kyoto-climate-deal-a-success-figures-reveal-mixed-results/)
1.9.2.1.5. Con: The success may have actually been due to the financial crisis slowing industry, or the Soviets 2.2 GtCO2/year reduction before the treaty was signed.
1.9.2.1.6. Pro: This success set the stage for the Paris Agreement.
1.9.3. Pro: Through the UNFCCC \([unfccc.int](http://unfccc.int)\), the UN has called on nations and stakeholders to utilize adaptation to climate change impacts such as storms or floods as an opportunity to build a better world for all.
1.9.3.1. Pro: The UNFCCC \(United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\), is "[the main international treaty on climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change)".
1.9.4. Pro: The [Montreal Protocol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Protocol) stopped the ozone hole growing over Antarctica, and was the first [unanimiously ratified international agreement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Protocol#cite_note-12).
1.9.4.1. Pro: The Montreal Protocol is [considered the most successful](http://www.igsd.org/worlds-most-successful-environmental-treaty-turns-25/) international environmental agreement to date.
1.9.4.2. Pro: This treaty was signed very quickly for an international treaty, with only 14 years lapsing between a basic scientific research discovery \(1973\) and the international agreement signed \(1985 & 1987\).
1.9.5. Pro: IPCC creates scientific reports on climate change that have more authority through their international cooperation and by being generated with a consensus through a UN-organisation.
1.10. Con: The UN is inefficient as it is run mostly by the USA. This means that if the UN voted to put sanctions against an ally of the USA that was breaking the Universal declaration of human rights it would most likely not go through and the same goes for other countries that the USA favours. This allows for the cherry picking of issues due to the dominance of the United states in funding the UN.
1.10.1. Con: The USA's [strongest ally](https://www.quora.com/Is-Israel-the-strongest-American-ally-in-the-Middle-East) in the middle east is Israel, and they have a [close and supportive relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93United_States_relations), but Israel still received more UN Human Rights condemnations than the rest of the world combined. This shows that the US is unable to cherry pick Human Rights issues.
1.10.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.
1.10.2. Con: The UN sets a [22%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#Funding) limit on contributions to the Regular Budget, based on the relative capacity of each country to pay, measured by its gross national income \(GNI\). This is designed so that countries with more money pay more, but the UN is not dependent on any one member to finance its operations.
1.10.3. Pro: The US contributes [$10 billion USD \(22%\)](https://www.cfr.org/article/funding-united-nations-what-impact-do-us-contributions-have-un-agencies-and-programs) of the UN's regular budget, and is the biggest contributor \([$1.6 billion USD / 9.3%](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/top-countries-contributing-to-the-united-nations.html)\) to the Voluntary Budget.
1.10.4. Con: The US is not able to use it's majority funding to influence the main decision making body of the UN: the General Assembly.
1.10.4.1. Pro: The [General Assembly votes to approve the regular budget](https://research.un.org/en/docs/budget/bodies), which means that the US cannot direct it's contributions based on it's own political interests.
1.10.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.2.
1.10.4.2. Pro: The [Fifth Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Fifth_Committee) and the [Audit Board](http://www.un.org/en/auditors/board/membership.shtml) are central in creating the budget, but the US is not a member of either and so is unable to directly influence the proposed budget.
1.10.5. Con: The UN has been quite unsuccessful in sanctioning every country that has broken the UN's declaration of human rights e.g. Israel which is committing many war crimes and illegally occupying Palestinian territory. Israel continues to enjoy support from UN countries and thus has been allowed to continue relatively unscathed from the UN. It receives a lot of support from the US which is a major country in the UN which shows how ineffective the UN is at implementing it's policies on US allies.
1.11. Pro: Overall the UN is a good thing - but that is not to say it is without the need for reform and change. Its strongest asset is perhaps its promotion of multilateralism, thus adding dynamic discussion to geopolitics and helping to prevent unitary decision making \(unless it is bypassed such as in 2003 second Iraq war\). At the same time it is founded on an out-of-date post WW2 structure. The UNSC is the highest authority within and it is not representative of a modern globalised world.
1.12. Con: The UN will not call out deliberate evil actions of some member nations.
1.12.1. Pro: The UN [did not call out the 1979 Bangladeshi genocide](https://www.quora.com/Which-atrocities-were-%E2%80%9Cignored%E2%80%9D-by-the-United-Nations), an atrocity which killed between 300 and 500 thousand.
1.12.1.1. Con: The UN successfully got 149 countries to agree on the [1948 Genocide Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide_Convention), which internationally condemns and provides the legal means to prevent or respond to genocide.
1.12.1.2. Con: The United Nations [condemned the human rights violations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_Bangladesh#United_Nations) during and following Operation Searchlight.
1.12.1.3. Pro: During the 1971 Bangladesh genocide committed by the Pakistan Army on Bangladeshis, the [UN was completely ineffective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_United_Nations#cite_note-Ball-31) in preventing the genocide.
1.12.1.3.1. Pro: The Pakistani army [launched their infamous ''Operation Searchlight' on March 25](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-wants-un-to-recognise-1971-genocide/articleshow/57795422.cms) to suppress Bengali people's calls for self determination, killing over 20,000 people alone in Dhaka. Officially 3 million people were killed in the subsequent none-month Liberation war.
1.12.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.1.
1.12.2. Pro: UN so far has [not passed a single resolution](http://balochwarna.com/2017/03/23/when-will-un-take-notice-of-baloch-genocide/) against Pakistan for committing [atrocities against Baloch people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency_in_Balochistan).
1.12.2.1. Pro: The Genocide in Balochistan has been raised at the UN by [the Baloch Republican Party \(BRP\) in 2016](https://www.dawn.com/news/1268562/brp-sets-up-camp-in-geneva-to-highlight-state-atrocities-against-baloch) and also by [India in 2017](https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/india-raises-balochistan-issue-unhcr-pakistan-human-rights-981545-2017-06-08).
1.12.2.2. Con: The UN has however condemned other higher profile actions by Pakistan \([Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_622), [Kashmir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_38), [Nuclear Tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1172)\), showing that Pakistan does not have a free pass on evil actions.
1.13. Con: The UN is slow, bureaucratic, and full of red tape.
1.13.1. Con: The first car was slow and unreliable but that does not mean a car is not, in principle, a good thing.
1.14. Con: Many UN operations have ended in scandal or disaster.
1.14.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.3.
1.14.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.1.1.
1.14.3. Con: Many have not. Many political careers end in scandal and disaster but we aren't phasing out politicians.
1.14.4. Pro: UN aid workers were the cause of a [cholera outbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010s_Haiti_cholera_outbreak) which killed over 10,000 Haitians and sickened hundreds of thousands more.  Yet the UN claimed diplomatic immunity and refused to provide compensation.
1.14.4.1. Pro: The UN [admitted responsibility](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/dec/01/haiti-cholera-outbreak-stain-on-reputation-un-says) only after 6 years.
1.14.4.2. Pro: The $400 million promised to repair damage was [only 2.2% funded](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-haiti-cholera-rights/un-criticized-for-failing-on-promise-to-help-haiti-cholera-victims-idUSKBN1I105G) \($8.7 million\) halfway through the fund’s expected three-year term.
1.14.4.3. Con: The UN did more good than bad in Haiti, with [three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Mission_in_Haiti) [peacekeeping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Stabilisation_Mission_in_Haiti) [missions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Mission_for_Justice_Support_in_Haiti) over 17 years and counting.
1.14.5. Con: This is also the case because the UN is relatively open to critique and can get critique from any organisation in the world as it meddles with the entire world.
1.14.6. Con: The UN also receives more critique because they are supposed to be a neutral organisation. As of late any military intervention of Russia is aimed at its own gain rather than helping locals or peace. They get critiqued for this, but it doesn't cause there efforts to be recognized as a scandal or disaster.
1.14.7. Pro: There have been numerous incidents of sexual abuse.
1.14.7.1. Con: The UN is taking [several good steps](https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/02/1003321) to prevent sexual abuse.
1.14.7.2. Pro: UN reports in DRC \(Democratic Republic of Congo\)  found allegations of [217 instances of peacekeepers who paid girls, aged 18 and under, for sexual relations with money, food or clothing](http://repository.un.org/bitstream/handle/11176/166198/A_61_841-EN.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y).
1.14.7.2.1. Pro: The Congo sex scandal, first uncovered in February 2004, [continued for over a year](https://www.thetrumpet.com/1853-the-corruption-of-the-united-nations) even after UN officials had knowledge of allegations that their peacekeepers had raped children as young as 12 and committed numerous other sex crimes.
1.14.7.2.2. Pro: Hundreds of images of child pornography involving Congolese children were [found on the laptop](https://www.thetrumpet.com/1853-the-corruption-of-the-united-nations) of a French UN civilian working in Goma.
1.14.7.2.3. Con: Only [six](https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/investigation-oios-allegations-sexual-exploitation-and-abuse-un) cases were fully substantiated.
1.14.7.2.3.1. Con: The UN [did not charge](https://www.thetrumpet.com/1853-the-corruption-of-the-united-nations) any of the six.
1.14.7.2.4. Pro: The UN also [received reports](http://repository.un.org/bitstream/handle/11176/166198/A_61_841-EN.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y) of 10 girls who had given birth to or were pregnant with children allegedly fathered by peacekeepers. In all, 75 peacekeepers were alleged to have engaged in sexual relations with Congolese girls.
1.14.7.3. Pro: Ruud Lubbers resigned as UN High Commissioner for Refugees after a confidential internal investigation by the OIOS [substantiated an allegation of sexual abuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruud_Lubbers#Sexual_harassment_complaint).
1.14.7.3.1. Pro: A copy of the report was [leaked a year later](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/harassment-intimidation-and-secrecy-un-chief-engulfed-in-sex-scandal-483851.html), revealing that further allegations surfaced, a pattern of sexual harassment was indicated, and that the verdict was "that Lubbers abused his authority to influence the outcome of the Investigation."
1.14.7.3.2. Pro: The U.N. Staff Union complained about the [lack of transparency](http://www.ipsnews.net/2004/12/corruption-un-failing-to-practise-good-governance/) in this investigation.
1.14.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.2.1.
1.14.7.5. Pro: European, U.N. troops accused of sexual abuse in Central African Republic - [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-centralafrica-un-crime-idUSKCN0V70XU)
1.14.7.6. Pro: Between 2004 and 2016, the United Nations [received almost 2,000 allegations](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/07/peacekeepers-harm-good-170730091925152.html) of sexual exploitation and abuse against its peacekeepers, according to an investigation by the Associated Press \(AP\).
1.15. Pro: The UN creates a forum — and an expectation for — dialogue between nations, furthering cooperation between independent nations.
1.15.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.8.
1.16. Con: The UN has an inability to prevent conflicts.
1.16.1. Pro: There are no legal consequences for violating a Security Council resolution
1.16.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.
1.16.3. Pro: The UN failed it's intervention with the Democratic Republic of Congo \(DRC\), previously the Republic of the Congo.
1.16.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.14.7.2.
1.16.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.1.
1.16.3.3. Con: The Congo was the UN's first peacekeeping mission with a significant military force, so some juvenile problems are to be expected.
1.16.3.4. Pro: [At least 1.7 million people](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/drc-violence-shows-kabila-determined-stay-power-180101102949537.html) were newly displaced in the Congo as the political situation deteriorated across the country this year \(2017\), according to ACAPS, a Geneva-based think-tank that monitors humanitarian developments.
1.16.3.5. Con: In March 2018, the UN Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \(MONUSCO\) [authorised 16,215 military personnel](https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/03/1006121), 660 military observers and staff officers, 391 police personnel, and 1,050 personnel of formed police units, until 31 March 2019.
1.16.3.5.1. Con: Renewed presence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo does not equate to a success.
1.16.3.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.1.2.
1.16.4. Pro: The UN has not prevented the Rwandan Genocide.
1.16.4.1. Pro: UN is chief Ban Ki-moon said the UN is still[ashamed over its failure](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-26917419) to prevent the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, saying "we could have done much more. We should have done much more".
1.16.5. Pro: The UN fails the Rohinga people in Myanmar.
1.16.5.1. Con: The UN has [reached a deal](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/31/asia/rohingya-resettlement-united-nations-intl/index.html) with Myanmar to work together to repatriate hundreds of thousands from refugee camps.
1.16.5.2. Con: The [UN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/16/asia/myanmar-rohingya-bangladesh-un-intl/index.html) and Bangladesh have both expressed concern for the Rohingya people's premature return, even with Myanmar's claim of repatriation of the first refugees.
1.16.6. Con: A [World Bank study \(p19\)](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://web.worldbank.org/archive/website01241/WEB/IMAGES/PCP3779S.PDF&ved=2ahUKEwiBvpCXuMvcAhUTVsAKHa5LAyMQFjAAegQIABAB&usg=AOvVaw1s0uSHJoJa7vgBUJ-bF89s) finds that UN intervention reduces the risk of peace failure by about 50%.
1.16.7. Con: UN peacekeeping forces have [drastically increased](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/03/02/un-peacekeeping-at-new-highs-after-post-cold-war-surge-and-decline/) in the last 1-2 decades, and are currently around 10 times higher than pre 1995 levels. Previous inabilities to prevent conflict may have been derived from this smaller peacekeeping force, and not a useful comparison to the UN's current ability.
1.16.8. Pro: -> See 1.12.1.3.
1.16.9. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.2.
1.16.10. Con: Since the UN exists there has been no war between major powers.
1.16.10.1. Con: [Proxy wars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_proxy_wars#Cold_War_proxy_wars) should also count \(Vietnam, Korea, Syria, Cuba invasion\).
1.16.10.2. Pro: The UN has been [beneficial in preventing](https://politicalviolenceataglance.org/2015/09/11/how-the-un-contributes-to-conflict-prevention/) armed combat between nations, which is a step in a positive direction.
1.16.10.3. Con: Major power wars have been avoided due to the threat of nuclear weapons.
1.16.10.3.1. Pro: The UN is [against](https://www.un.org/disarmament/wmd/nuclear/) nuclear weapons.
1.16.10.4. Con: There was a League of Nations in place before and there was a major power war.
1.16.10.4.1. Con: The League of Nations broke down at the onset of WW2 in the 1930's, as it couldn't deal with the rise of Germany or Italy.
1.16.10.4.2. Con: The previous league of nations did not include the majority of the world's countries, in fact, it only had a third of them.
1.16.11. Con: -> See 1.15.
1.16.12. Pro: Srebrenica had been declared a UN "safe area" and was even protected by 400 armed Dutch peace keepers, but the UN forces [did nothing to prevent the largest case of mass murder](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/05/watched-massacre-unfold-croatia-160520085629629.html) on the European continent since WWII.
1.16.12.1. Pro: 'We were perfectly aware of what was about to happen. Our mission was a tragic failure. Everyone considered it a form of desertion. Pulling out under such circumstances was an act of total cowardice,' - [Colonel Luc Marchal, UN commanding officer in rwanda.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/dec/19/theobserver3)  The first few thousand died within hours of the start of the UN withdrawal.
1.16.13. Pro: The UN has more [failures](http://www.idppcenter.com/UN_Peacekeeping_Failures.pdf) recorded than successes.
1.16.13.1. Pro: A [study \(pg5\)](http://Short-Term and Long-Term Effects of United Nations Peacekeeping Operations - World Bank Group PDFweb.worldbank.org › WEB › IMAGES) identifies 84 failures and 37 successes of peace, using a strict definition of peace which counts ongoing UN intervention as a failure to achieve peace yet.
1.16.14. Pro: [In 1995](http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/no-man-left-behind/articles/behind-the-battle-of-mogadishu/) the UN's mission to Somalia ended in failure, after thousands of Somali and US casualties. Somalia remains a severely impoverished and troubled country.
1.16.15. Pro: The UN has little power in changing the international governmental systems which result in power struggles between states, and it therefore has limited influence.
1.17. Pro: The UN has moved us closer to world peace.
1.17.1. Con: The problem with the UN is that it is very difficult to arbitrate a dispute when one side or the other is not committed to peace and unwilling to compromise.
1.17.1.1. Con: Trying something difficult \(but positive\) should be considered a good thing.
1.17.1.1.1. Pro: Trying to tackle the hardest challenges could be considered better than only tackling easy challenges.
1.17.1.1.1.1. Pro: Tackling the hardest can help the UN better learn how to create bigger impact in the world.
1.17.1.2. Con: -> See 1.4.9.1.
1.17.1.3. Pro: This is an age-old problem. Even worse now when people are “not open to any agreement.“ \([2 Timothy 3:3](http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-3.htm)\)
1.17.1.3.1. Con: Many argue that we are in the [most peaceful](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/steven-pinker-this-is-historys-most-peaceful-time-new-study-not-so-fast/) period of human history, and human rights have [greatly improved](https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/human-rights/what-are-human-rights/history-human-rights) in recent history.

This would suggest we are not in the [last days](http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-1.htm), and may in-fact be in the best position in history to move towards world peace.
1.17.1.3.2. Con: Even if it is difficult or harder than ever, we [should all make every effort to live in peace](https://www.biblestudytools.com/hebrews/12-14.html) with everyone.
1.17.1.4. Pro: World peace is an unreachable dream, as the majority seldom wants real peace.
1.17.1.5. Con: Difficult does not mean impossible. It is possible to still bring about some positive change without complete and full cooperation.
1.17.2. Pro: The UN has earned [Nobel Peace Prize Eleven times](http://www.un.org/en/sections/nobel-peace-prize/united-nations-and-nobel-peace-prize/), more than any other entity.
1.17.2.1. Pro: "In 70 years, the United Nations, its specialised agencies, related agencies, funds, programmes and staff were awarded the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize eleven times. One agency, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \(UNHCR\) received the famous prize in both 1954 and 1981."
1.17.2.2. Con: The Nobel Peace Prize is often used as a political tool, granting authority and legitimacy rather than recognizing actual achievement.
1.17.2.2.1. Pro: The Nobel Peace Prize was inappropriately given to Palestinian leader [Yasser Arafat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasser_Arafat) and Israeli leaders [Shimon Peres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimon_Peres) and [Yitzhak Rabin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzhak_Rabin) for the [Oslo Accords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Accords).
1.17.2.2.1.1. Pro: Yasser Arafat wore his [holstered pistol](https://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2012/09/6_memorable_props_used_by_spea.html) before addressing the General Assembly.
1.17.2.2.1.2. Pro: Shimon Peres was [involved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimon_Peres#1956_Suez_Crisis) \(as Director-General of the Ministry of Defence, alongside the UK and France\) with planning the 1956 [Suez Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Crisis).
1.17.2.2.1.3. Pro: Yasser Afarat is often accused of being the "[Father of Modern Terrorism](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Father+of+Modern+Terrorism)" for [acts including](https://www.quora.com/Was-Yasser-Arafat-a-terrorist) founding [Fatah](http://www.defenddemocracy.org/media-hit/the-father-of-modern-terrorism-the-true-legacy-of-yasser-arafat/), and the [PLO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization#Political_status).
1.17.2.2.1.4. Pro: James Phillips [wrote](https://www.heritage.org/homeland-security/report/detoxifying-yasser-arafats-disastrous-legacy) for The Heritage Foundation \(a US conservative public policy think tank\) that "Yasser Arafat, who died on November 11, has left the Middle East a more brutal, nasty, and toxic place. Arafat's disastrous leadership exploded the once promising Arab-Israeli peace process and left the Palestinians mired in growing violence, anarchy, and misery."
1.17.2.2.1.5. Con: The Oslo Accords were a huge step forward for peace, and established a timetable for the Middle East peace process.

Even if both sides had committed many wrongs, rewarding major progress in one of the longest running modern disputes helps encourage future cooperation, and reward the work so far.
1.17.2.2.2. Pro: The Nobel Peace Prize 2013 was awarded to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons "for its extensive efforts to eliminate chemical weapons", and yet there were subsequent chemical weapons attacks in [Syria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douma_chemical_attack) and the [UK](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/novichok-attack-russian-spies-airport-security-how-smuggled-chemical-weapon-russia-uk-a8534511.html)
1.17.2.2.3. Pro: The [2007 Nobel Peace prize](http://www.un.org/en/sections/nobel-peace-prize/intergovernmental-panel-climate-change-ipcc-and-albert-arnold-al-gore-jr/index.html) was awarded for climate change, but 11 years on very little progress has been made that could be attributed to UN actions.
1.17.2.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.9.
1.17.2.2.4. Pro: The 2005 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the International Atomic Energy Agency \(IAEA\), and yet the UN clearly failed to address nuclear proliferation in North Korea, Iran, and a lack of clarity on Iraq’s nuclear programme helped lead to the Iraq war.
1.17.2.2.4.1. Con: The UN has moved the world towards Nuclear Disarmament.
1.17.2.2.4.1.1. Pro: [Nuclear Weapon Ban Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Prohibition_of_Nuclear_Weapons) - the UN Achieved the first legally binding international agreement on nuclear weapons.
1.17.2.2.4.1.1.1. Con: No nuclear powers or members of NATO have signed.
1.17.2.2.4.1.1.2. Pro: The vast majority of the world [agreed](https://www.un.org/disarmament/tpnw/index.html) on this treaty. [122 were in favour,](https://s3.amazonaws.com/unoda-web/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/A.Conf_.229.2017.L.3.Rev_.1.pdf) 1 voted against \(Netherlands\), and 1 abstained \(Singapore\). Others abstained.
1.17.2.2.4.1.1.3. Con: History shows that similar treaties like [the NPT](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons) have been used to apply political pressure \(e.g. [War against Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_and_the_Iraq_War) and [sanctions against Iran](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/05/17/in-exiting-the-iran-deal-trump-left-u-n-sanctions-relief-intact-why-that-could-pose-problems-down-the-road/)\).
1.17.2.2.4.1.2. Con: It is still debated whether nuclear weapons are positive or negative.
1.17.2.2.4.1.2.1. Pro: -> See discussion #1108: The U.S. had to use nuclear weapons to achieve its goal of Japan unconditionally surrendering.
1.17.2.2.4.1.2.2. Pro: -> See discussion #1125: An intended first use of strategic nuclear weapons is morally wrong.
1.17.2.2.4.1.2.3. Pro: -> See discussion #2853: The US should not try to force North Korea to abandon its nuclear program.
1.17.2.2.4.1.3. Pro: [Non-Proliferation Treaty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons) \(NPT\) - The UN achieved the first international agreement to pursue nuclear disarmament.
1.17.2.2.4.1.3.1. Pro: More countries have adhered to the NPT [than any other arms limitation and disarmament agreement](https://www.un.org/disarmament/wmd/nuclear/npt/) \(191 states, [as of August 2016](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons)\).
1.17.2.2.4.1.4. Con: When North Korea broke the UN's nuclear rules, the UN failed to prevent them from continuing nuclear development.
1.17.2.2.4.1.4.1. Con: The UN was able to apply [universal sanctions since 2006](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctions_against_North_Korea#United_Nations_Security_Council_sanctions), which no other entity is able to do. The sanctions were obligatory for all states around the world.
1.17.2.2.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.17.2.2.4.1.4.
1.17.2.2.5. Pro: The [2001 Nobel Peace prize](http://www.un.org/en/sections/nobel-peace-prize/united-nations-and-kofi-annan/index.html) went to Kofi Annan for his work “for a better organized and more peaceful world” and to “revitalise the UN”. This woolly reasoning acknowledges that the UN was underperforming beforehand, and 20 years later the UN appears to still be underperforming.
1.17.2.2.6. Con: The [1988 Nobel Prize](http://www.un.org/en/sections/nobel-peace-prize/united-nations-peacekeeping-forces/index.html) to UN Peacekeeping forces appears well justified, although this was now 30 years ago.
1.17.2.2.7. Pro: Barack Obama [received](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Nobel_Peace_Prize) the Nobel Prize once, suggesting that recipients are not necessarily deserving.
1.17.2.2.7.1. Pro: Geir Lundestad, director of the Nobel Institute for 25 years until stepping down last year, [indicated](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/09/18/former-top-nobel-official-says-maybe-obamas-peace-prize-was-not-such-a-good-idea/72396794/) the prize was in anticipation of and intended to help Obama rid the world of nuclear weapons. This of course did not happen, suggesting the award was not, in the end, deserved.
1.17.3. Pro: The UN's [International Court of Justice](http://www.icj-cij.org/en) \(also known as the World Court\) is the worlds highest court, settling disputes between nations.
1.17.3.1. Con: The World Court has no automatic jurisdiction forcing the 193 member states to submit to decisions, unless both parties have agreed to submit to its decision.
1.17.3.1.1. Con: The Security Council is used as enforcement for any disputes involving aggression.
1.17.3.1.1.1. Con: The permanent members of the Security Council are able to veto enforcement of cases, even those to which they are the defendant, or which they consented to be bound.
1.17.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: The Republic of Nicaragua [successfully won](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua_v._United_States) a ICJ court case against the USA, who had supported a rebellion against the Nicaraguan government and mined Nicaragua's harbors.

However, the USA used it's Security Council power to block enforcement and prevented Nicaragua from obtaining any compensation.
1.17.3.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The [Court found that](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Qu7QCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA381&lpg=PA381&dq="breach+of+its+obligations+under+customary+international+law+not+to+use+force+against+another+State"&source=bl&ots=TTdg-nCxwB&sig=0PNimCg9rT2dE0jH6T0IEfKxvAk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiA6b2G3pfcAhVlJ8AKHTPYBC8Q6AEwAXoECAUQAQ#v=onepage&q="breach%20of%20its%20obligations%20under%20customary%20international%20law%20not%20to%20use%20force%20against%20another%20State"&f=false) the United States was
"in breach of its obligations under customary international law not to use force against another State",
"not to intervene in its affairs",
"not to violate its sovereignty",
"not to interrupt peaceful maritime commerce", and
"in breach of its obligations under Article XIX of the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between the Parties signed at Managua on 21 January 1956."
1.17.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.
1.17.3.2. Con: Organizations, private enterprises, and individuals cannot have their cases taken to the International Court or appeal a national supreme court's ruling.
This means that the potential victims of crimes against humanity, such as minor ethnic groups or indigenous peoples, may not have appropriate backing by a state.
1.17.4. Pro: [Keeps peace](http://www.un.org/en/un-facts/index.html) with 117,000 peacekeepers in 15 operations in 4 continents.
1.17.5. Con: Although true in the past, this does not appear to be true in recent years.
1.17.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.
1.17.6. Pro: -> See 1.17.2.2.4.1.
1.17.7. Pro: UN is one of the biggest platform to establish peace in the world.
1.17.7.1. Pro: The UN has 193 member states, and including observer states/states with non-member access it brings together every country in the world.
1.17.8. Pro: -> See 1.16.10.2.
1.17.9. Con: The UN has failed to maintain consistency in peace among countries.
1.17.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.16.
