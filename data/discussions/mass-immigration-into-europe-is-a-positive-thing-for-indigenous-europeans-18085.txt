Discussion Title: Mass immigration into Europe is a positive thing for indigenous Europeans.

1. Mass immigration into Europe is a positive thing for indigenous Europeans.
1.1. Con: High and low skilled workers take away opportunities available to indigenous Europeans.
1.1.1. Con: There is a [lack of apprenticeships](https://nrl.co.uk/knowledge-hub/lack-of-apprenticeships-highlighted-as-one-of-the-issues-behind-britains-worst-skills-shortage-for-30-years/) in the UK.
1.1.2. Con: Employers often prefer employees who speak European languages well. Immigrants often have to overcome prejudice to get a job.
1.2. Con: Increasing the population through mass immigration risks making the indigenous population \(and their culture and identity\) a minority in their own country with successive generations of immigration.
1.2.1. Con: This is not an important thing to worry about.
1.3. Pro: Mass immigration can help in the long term to sustain social security systems, which are endangered by the demographic change most European nations suffer from.
1.3.1. Con: The solution to demographic changes should not be to import the next generations from other countries.
1.4. Pro: High skill immigrants will fill voids that cannot be filled by indigenous Europeans.
1.4.1. Pro: The competition in the job market may also help provoke indigenous Europeans to seek higher education and become more skilled themselves.
1.4.2. Pro: Low skill immigrants will fill gaps in jobs that indigenous Europeans do not want to do.
1.4.2.1. Con: This could inspire complacency from indigenous Europeans.
1.4.3. Con: High skill immigrants can labour migrate.
1.4.4. Con: Low skill immigrants competes with the younger generations.
1.5. Con: Diversity through immigration, ruins the diversity Europe has within itself.
1.5.1. Con: This is wholly subjective. Diversity is diversity, some types are not better than others.
1.5.1.1. Con: [Monogamy is crucial for a peaceful society.](http://www.rationaloptimist.com/blog/polygamy-fuels-violence/) In countries which have a higher percentage of population in polygamous marriage keep erupting with local unrest \([See analysis](https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2017/12/19/the-link-between-polygamy-and-war)\). And this effect was seen in Europe \([Paris](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/1503245/Migrant-polygamy-helped-cause-riots.html)\) as well. Polygamy also leads to child marriage, as the need for brides has to be satisfied. Having a polygamous society within your state is therefore not beneficial.
1.5.1.2. Con: Different cultures have different values, and some are not compatible with European values. In rural India for example, [cows are worth more than women](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-40404102). If we would just import all Indians without selection, and without demanding integration from them, we would have the same here.
1.5.1.2.1. Con: Not all Indians believe in this; it is an outdated view, much like Christianity used to believe that women were owned by their parents and had zero rights. It is not fair to judge an entire nation on the lowest common denominator.
1.5.1.3. Con: The success of [faith schools](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2016/08/29/faith-schools-are-beacons-of-intellectual-rigour/) shows that diversity isn't always beneficial. Uniformity, takes many obstacles out of the way, and therefore enables better results.
1.5.2. Con: British diversity includes the cultural diversity of Commonwealth countries. European diversity comes from everywhere, it is already part of us.
1.6. Pro: Immigrants will bring an array of culture not experienced by Europeans.
1.6.1. Pro: Immigrants will bring a diversity of food to Europe.
1.6.1.1. Con: Europe already has a plethora of ethnic food, such as in Halal butcheries or African stores.
1.6.2. Con: Diversity leads to a decease in trust and cohesion within a community: [drive.google.com](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FvFN8ACY6taivkcbzDGgYy1-EPb1kbbQ/view)
1.6.3. Con: This is wholly subjective.
1.6.4. Con: There is no guarantee that that array of culture is in it´s entirety positive.
1.6.5. Con: This is demonstrably not always good, in the case of no-go zones in European countries with high levels of immigration. Especially in the UK and Sweden. [en.m.wikipedia.org](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-go_area)
1.7. Con: There is a limit to every thing. Countries can't, for example, deplete all of its resources to helping others. Today there is no upper limit to how much immigration there is to countries \(except from extremes\).
1.8. Pro: Mass immigration will help redistribute wealth from the rich to the poor, which is difficult to do without being in the same country.
1.8.1. Pro: The economy is a pyramid scheme and subsequently populations must continue to grow to sustain the hierarchy. The only way to do that is through mass immigration.
1.8.1.1. Con: The increase of population increases rent cost and lowers wages by the increased competition. Especially in low skill labour.
1.8.2. Con: Overall poverty of the world is declining rapidly and UNs goal is to annihilate extreme poverty by 2030. [un.org](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/)
1.8.3. Con: Mass immigration increases the competition for jobs and lowers wages. This serves big companies but not the employed poor and middle class people.
1.8.4. Con: It is not a positive thing for indigenous Europeans when wealth is redistributed to immigrants
1.9. Con: Immigration from third world countries tends to create a burden on the welfare state that has been established in European countries.
1.9.1. Pro: [99% of immigrants in Germany in 2016 were unemployed](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/710927/million-migrants-Germany-unemployed-Merkel-open-door-policy), [only 0.3% in Sweden had found jobs in 2017](https://www.dailywire.com/news/18546/03-refugees-who-flooded-sweden-now-have-jobs-joseph-curl). That is a lot of people who then needs to live on welfare to survive in just those two countries.
1.9.2. Pro: Currently the reason for mass immigration are humanitarian. A study in Sweden suggests that immigrants costs 8 404 USD annually. Full report in Swedish: [eso.expertgrupp.se](https://eso.expertgrupp.se/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ESO-2018_3-Tid-for-integration.pdf) English summary: [eso.expertgrupp.se](https://eso.expertgrupp.se/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Summary.pdf) This study is however very conservative since it does not consider the cost of Sweden’s agencies that support migrants and/or handles migrants such as Sweden’s migration agency which 2016 cost 6.696205 billion U.S. dollars. It also does not consider the rise of inmates in prisons etc.
1.10. Con: Crime rates increase in European countries as more immigration comes in.
1.10.1. Con: In [Germany](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-crime-rate-drops-but-fear-rises/a-43692277), crime rates dropped after the influx of immigrants.
1.10.2. Pro: In [Sweden](https://www.bra.se/bra-in-english/home/crime-and-statistics/swedish-crime-survey.html), crime rates have been rising significantly each year since the migrant influx of 2015/2016.
