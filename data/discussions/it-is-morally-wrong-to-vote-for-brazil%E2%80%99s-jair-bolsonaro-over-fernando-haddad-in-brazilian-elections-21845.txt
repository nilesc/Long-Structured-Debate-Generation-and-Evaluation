Discussion Title: It is morally wrong to vote for Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro over Fernando Haddad in Brazilian elections

1. Is it morally wrong to vote for Jair Bolsonaro over Fernando Haddad in Brazilian elections?
1.1. Pro: Bolsonaro is a threat to democracy and democratic institutions
1.1.1. Con: Bolsonaro is being [accused](https://www.france24.com/en/20181019-brazil-election-far-right-bolsonaro-accused-criminal-network-campaign-finance) of using fake news and many other unethical strategies to gain votes
1.1.2. Con: So is the worker's party \(PT\), which is actively pushing for policies that control free speech and suggest releasing convicted prisoners.
1.2. Con: In democracies there are no morally good or morally bad candidates. If a majority of people prefer a certain candidate over another, then that's the will of the majority.
1.2.1. Pro: Recent polls show that [57%](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-election-poll/brazil-election-poll-shows-bolsonaro-has-57-percent-vs-haddad-43-percent-idUSKCN1MW2BN) of the Brazilian population will vot for Bolsonaro.
1.2.2. Con: There are morally good and morally bad candidates. They are elected by morally good or morally bad voters.
1.3. Pro: Bolsonaro created a character in the latest years trying to show an economic liberal profile, even though most of his past actions in politics were to strengthen the government over the economy
1.3.1. Con: People are known to change their minds once presented with compelling arguments. Bolsonaro has already [admitted](https://oglobo.globo.com/brasil/exclusivo-nao-entendo-mesmo-de-economia-afirma-jair-bolsonaro-22908268) to be ignorant in regards to economic policy, and has a competent finance minister.
1.4. Pro: Bolsonaro’s speech will increase violence against minorities in Brazil
1.4.1. Con: Violence against minorities is less of an issue than economic stagnation and poverty.
1.4.1.1. Con: They shouldn't be decisions that exclude one another. Both are co-related. Poverty is a social minority.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: They shouldn't, however the binary nature of elections forces it so. Poverty is NOT a social minority, given that 25% of Brazilians are currently below the poverty line.
1.4.1.2. Con: Violence against minorities is indirectly attached to poverty which, in a long term, leads to economic stagnation
1.4.1.2.1. Con: It's the opposite. Violence against minorities tend to decrease as economic prosperity increases. The causality effect is the opposite.
1.4.2. Pro: Bolsonaro utilizes a hate speech to promote himself among a conservative electorate, thus, through social conformity, violence behavior toward minorities increases
1.5. Pro: Bolsonaro supports the past military dictatorship in Brazil and its torture episodes
1.5.1. Con: He is allied with military forces, such as his vice-president
1.5.1.1. Pro: [Antes de Mourão](https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2018/08/05/politica/1533482571_722395.html), his vice president, is a general.
1.5.1.2. Con: His vice-president is a retired General \(one very good at that\), and this isn't necessarily bad, seeing that some of USA's best presidents were from the military.
1.6. Con: People vote for him due to the recession created by 16 years of corrupt left wing governments
1.6.1. Pro: The Brazilian GDP in 2017 was the same as in 2011 \(in USD\).
1.7. Con: Even with radical opinions, a president does not hold power enough to oppress people in a country like Brazil, due to its plurality and the level of engagement concerning individual rights that was achieved this election
1.7.1. Con: -> See 1.4.
1.8. Con: His only opponent in the second round gets most of his votes from Lula, who is convicted for 12 years for corruption, and the entire campaign was build over the premise that this was a polictical arrest instead of a criminal one, suggesting dishonesty
1.8.1. Con: -> See 1.2.
1.8.2. Pro: [Lula](https://www.france24.com/en/20180912-lula-calls-voters-support-fernando-haddad-letter-prison-brazil-presidency-elections) appealed to voters to elect Haddad.
1.9. Con: Haddad is being prosecuted, while Bolsonaro is supposedly clean
1.9.1. Con: it has been proven that Bolsonaro washed money. he even admited it at an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D62y7u04-U8).
