Discussion Title: What is the best reaction to an alien encounter ?

1. What is the best reaction to an alien encounter ?
1.1. Freeze, stay calm and observe the alien behavior.
1.1.1. Pro: Any move or sound might be interpreted as threatening in the eyes of the alien. He might then either run away or attack you.
1.1.2. Con: If the alien has bad intentions, he'll have a chance to kill you or kidnap you.
1.1.2.1. Con: If you observe him well, you will quickly notice his bad intentions, and react accordingly.
1.1.2.2. Con: If the alien is stronger, he will be able to kill you regardless.
1.1.3. Pro: Many species, including humans, have the instinct to freeze in a dangerous situation. According to Darwin's principles, that we adopted and kept that instinct is a proof that this is a an effective survival strategy.
1.1.4. Con: If you freeze, the Alien might see you as unintelligent life, insofar as that is relevant given the relative intelligence between the involved species.
1.1.5. Pro: They likely planned for this encounter and therefore they are likely to take initiative. More accurately, if we see a \(controlled, not purely mechanical\) UFO with aliens in it, it would rather take place in a city or public space, since their choice would be to reveal themselves.
1.2. Try to attack him and kill him before he kills you.
1.2.1. Con: If the alien actually had peaceful intentions, you would probably miss the most interesting experience in your lifetime: [communicating with the alien](https://www.kialo.com/what-is-the-best-reaction-to-an-alien-encounter--10097/10097.0=10097.4).
1.2.2. Con: He might be deadlier than you, so attacking him would likely cause your death.
1.2.2.1. Pro: As he has the advanced technology to travel to Earth, he might have an advanced weapon technology.
1.2.3. Con: If the alien was peaceful and was sent to Earth to get to know humanity, killing the alien could mean sending a war message to its fellow aliens.
1.2.4. Con: Maybe the alien came here in order to warn us about some danger coming to Earth, and help us. After we killed him we won't be prepared to face that danger, and Humankind could be destroyed.
1.3. Pray to God.
1.3.1. Con: When you encounter an alien, you'll have a proof that aliens exist, hence that some of your beliefs are wrong \(for example the Bible says that Earth is the only inhabited planet\). Then God may not exist.
1.3.2. Pro: Praying can give you hope in a dangerous situation.
1.4. Run away as fast as possible.
1.4.1. Pro: If he is dangerous, running away gives you the most chances to survive.
1.4.1.1. Con: Running away may send the wrong message: the alien may then persecute you.
1.4.2. Con: If the alien was peaceful, you would probably miss the most interesting experience in your lifetime: meeting with an alien.
1.5. Attempt to communicate with him.
1.5.1. Pro: The more we know about him, the [less we fear him](https://www.popsci.com/visit-explores-what-would-actually-happen-if-aliens-came-to-earth#page-2).
1.5.2. Pro: This is an unprecedented occasion to satisfy our curiosity about alien life.
1.5.3. Con: He may harm you.
1.5.4. Pro: If the alien answers to you in English \(or any Earth language\), then maybe it's a disguised human comedian acting for a movie or a prank. If you're still not sure, then you can ask him to prove that he's an alien.
1.6. Befriend them and collaborate with them if possible.
1.6.1. Pro: Share things like technology and resources to open new economic channels and possibilities if possible.
1.6.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.
1.7. Call the police.
1.7.1. Pro: A police officer will have a gun, so he/she will protect you.
1.7.1.1. Con: An armed police officer can escalate the situation and ending up killing the alien.
1.7.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.
1.7.2. Con: The police will not take your call seriously.
1.7.3. Con: It is likely that the police will be able to do nothing to protect you.
1.7.3.1. Con: The police will then contact any relevant organism able to deal with the situation.
1.7.3.1.1. Con: Governmental agencies may hide the discovery to the public, or even destroy the alien and evidences.
1.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.7.3.1.
1.8. Perform a [Reality Check](http://lucid.wikia.com/wiki/Reality_check). Encountering an alien is so extraordinary, that it might likely be just a dream.
1.8.1. Pro: If it turns out to be a dream, it will be an opportunity to have a [lucid dream](http://www.world-of-lucid-dreaming.com/what-is-lucid-dreaming.html) which is an amazing experience.
1.9. Hide, and hope he didn't see you.
1.9.1. Pro: He might be dangerous, and you don't know what are your chances to escape him.
1.9.1.1. Pro: He might run faster than you.
1.9.1.2. Pro: He might have weapons.
1.9.2. Con: Hope will not save you if you are unlucky.
1.10. Warn them about germs. No point in contact with Faster Than Light-capable species if our diseases wipe out both societies.
1.10.1. Pro: Maybe germs do not exist on their planet and they are not protected against them.
1.10.1.1. Pro: People in different countries can have different immune systems, be it from previous exposure or genes. Some of those who survived the black plague in Europe managed to do so because of an [inherent immunity](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/02/black-death-left-mark-human-genome), and cowpox will bestow immunity to the deadly [smallpox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox_vaccine). Someone who interacts with an African tribe could unknowingly doom them to the bubonic plague. If this is an issue across countries, it will definitely be one across galaxies.
1.10.1.2. Con: That does not eliminate the fact that this should be one of the first things checked, once communication is established.
1.10.2. Con: Given their assumed intelligence and technology and information gathering, tied to their ability to achieve FTL \(Faster Than Light-travel\), and the fact that we can conceive of this problem, I would assume the warning to be unnecessary and potentially adding to communication issues given the potential triviality of our warning. They might see us as primitive beings because of it.
1.11. Make a video.
1.11.1. Pro: You don't know how long the Alien will stay on Earth, and it would be a pity to not have a record before he leaves.
1.11.2. Pro: The video will certainly go viral.
1.11.3. Con: While taking the video, you'll be less focused and reactive in case he attacks you.
1.11.3.1. Con: In terms of cost-benefit, your individual death may be less important than your video testimonial is for humanity.
1.11.3.1.1. Con: Nothing is more important than one's live.
1.11.4. Pro: This event would be so extraordinary, that you literally wouldn't believe your eyes. Taking a video would prove that you are not hallucinating or dreaming, and that what you're seeing is really happening.
1.12. If the alien has a shape similar to an Earth animal, behave [as recommended for that animal encounter](https://www.wikihow.com/Escape-from-Dangerous-Forest-Animals). For example if he looks like a bear, react as you would do to a bear.
1.12.1. Pro: It might actually BE an Earth animal, you just didn't know about that animal before.
1.12.2. Pro: Reactions to wild animals have been developed since the dawn of life on Earth. Hence they are the most adapted and known reactions to any kind of life encounter.
1.12.3. Con: Aliens may have a totally different social behavior. What woud be interpreted as a peace sign by an Earth animal could be interpreted as a war sign by an alien.
1.12.3.1. Pro: Aliens may be way more intelligent than a regular Earth animal.
1.12.4. Con: Most people do not really know the actual procedures when encountering a wild animal and cannot therefore follow them.
1.12.4.1. Pro: For example, running away from a [gorilla](http://www.berggorilla.org/en/gorillas/general/habitat/are-gorillas-dangerous-to-people/), instead of submissively crouching down and looking at the ground, can cause a gorilla to chase and bite.
1.12.5. Con: Aliens are unlikely to look like Earth animals.
1.12.5.1. Con: If they come from a planet that has similar conditions than Earth, then they might have evolved in a similar way.
1.12.5.2. Pro: The form that Earth animals have adopted would not be adapted on a foreign planet that has very different conditions.
1.12.5.3. Con: Earth life have a large variety of forms. Whatever the Aliens look like, we can chose one Earth animal that looks similar, even if the degree of similitude is small.
