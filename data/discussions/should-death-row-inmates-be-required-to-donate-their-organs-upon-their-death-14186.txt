Discussion Title: Should Death Row Inmates Be Required To Donate Their Organs Upon Their Death?

1. Death row inmates should be required to donate their organs upon their death.
1.1. Con: Executions often make organs unusable. They would have to be harvested prior to execution.
1.1.1. Con: It is [unknown](http://www.newsweek.com/how-death-rows-request-give-his-organs-kept-him-alive-326552) quite what lethal injection - currently the only humane and actively used form of execution - would do to the body's organs. They may well be perfectly fine.
1.1.2. Pro: [Lethal injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation_in_the_United_States_prison_population#Death_row_inmates) can make organs unusable due to hypoxia, meaning they would need to be harvested very quickly.
1.1.2.1. Con: A [guillotine will give a quick death](https://www.crimemuseum.org/crime-library/execution/the-guillotine/) that leaves the rest of the body intact. Organs can be harvested quite quickly after the spectacle and preserved for a [decent amount of time.](http://www.transweb.org/faq/q24.shtml)
1.2. Con: Besides the ethics behind it - knowing they are FORCED to give up their organs, they may try and find a way to mess them up.
1.2.1. Con: Death row inmates have no rational reason and no benefit to reap from sabotaging their own body prior to organ extraction.
1.2.1.1. Con: Criminal action is not always rational; sheer bloody-mindedness against a system they detest may be sufficient perceived benefit for them.
1.2.2. Pro: Due to the high rates of rape in prison, a death row prisoner [can be exposed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13678544) to several STDs.
1.3. Pro: Death row inmates will just die anyway so there is no reason to waste their organs.
1.3.1. Con: Organ removal can be seen as desecration, which goes beyond simple death.
1.4. Con: Knowing that death row inmates will have their organs donated may encourage more rulings by judges in favour of the death penalty.
1.4.1. Pro: From a utilitarian perspective, taking the life of a criminal to save the life/lives of multiple innocent people makes perfect sense.
1.4.2. Pro: The justice systems of our societies are often argued to be deeply flawed, therefore, before adding features to these systems we ought to first focus on the flaws.
1.4.3. Con: Death will not be taken lightly regardless; it is unfair to assume that judges will be so callous.
1.5. Con: Organ trafficking has the same concept as in human trafficking because humans and their parts are treated as commodities, which is immoral.
1.5.1. Con: In a resources-scarce society, it would be more immoral to let perfectly intact organs go to waste as this might cost the lives of multiple innocent people who relied on organ donations to survive.
1.6. Con: Inmates should at least be given the autonomy by having them consent to their organs being harvested, and should not be forced.
1.6.1. Pro: Perhaps an opt-out system would work. Death row inmates are automatically signed up for organ donations, and can ask to be removed from it if they wish.
1.6.2. Pro: Inmates are still humans and deserve to preserve their human rights, such as [bodily integrity.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodily_integrity)
1.7. Pro: The mere fact that they are on death row means that their human right to live will already be violated. Thus, it means that their right to their body upon their deaths can be forfeit as well.
1.7.1. Con: Two wrongs don't make a right.
1.8. Pro: There is no reason to respect a death row inmate's wishes as they have violated other people's rights.
1.8.1. Con: The era of "an eye for an eye" have been over for years. Justice system is not "vindication" system.
1.8.1.1. Con: The eye-for-an-eye \(EFAE\) judicial system is still in effect. Every code of law on the planet regards punishment of the offender as a legitimate method of achieving justice. Punishment following a crime, even if carried out by the state, is nothing but a form of revenge and hence follows the EFAE mentality.
1.8.1.2. Pro: To a degree, it is. Opinions differ as to whether prison sentencing is - or should be - either punitive or rehabilitation.
1.8.2. Pro: The types of crimes that merit death row are serious breaches of humanity, generally murder or similar crimes. The violation of rights is far greater than with normal, lower-level criminality.
1.8.3. Con: Human rights are supposed to be unalienable. As such, their wishes should still be honoured.
1.9. Con: People are still subject to a humane death only and any additional punishment such as organ harvesting is unethical.
1.9.1. Con: It would be more unethical to let fellow humans die to an unavailability of replacement organs than to allow an individual to keep his organs upon death.
1.9.2. Con: Post-mortem organ harvesting is not a punishment. Unless considering religious arguments, punishments enacted by the state are meant only for the living.
1.9.3. Pro: Organ harvesting before death will cause unnecessary suffering for the victim.
1.9.3.1. Con: Organ harvesting prior to death is not an issue nor is it being done.
1.9.4. Pro: Doctors performing organ transplantation would violate ethical codes, such as the [AMA Code of Medical Ethics](https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/ama-code-medical-ethics) and the General Medical Council's [Good Medical Practice](https://www.gmc-uk.org/ethical-guidance/ethical-guidance-for-doctors/good-medical-practice).
1.10. Pro: In a utilitarian perspective, even if one claims that an inmate's autonomy is violated, harvesting their organs upon their death will benefit more people and that outweighs the negative effect.
1.10.1. Con: The concept of violating autonomy harms more people in society \(or say death row\) than the life/lives saves my harvesting that first person's organs, and deciding to neglect their bodily autonomy.
